Now, we know what you’re thinking:That doesn't apply to small YouTube channels, let alone one that doesn't have 181 million subscribers.
But what if we told you it absolutelycanwork? What if we told you that viral YouTube videos aren't all that mysterious?

What Is a Viral Video?
Viral videos gain popularity through internet sharing, typically on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. In fact, Harvard Business Review reported that videos reach their viral peak faster when shared withinthe first 48 hours. Videos are considered 'viral' when they reach 2 million views (or more) in just a few days.
What Causes a Video to Go Viral?
Let's return to the HBR article to answer this question. In the post, HBR shares interesting data from Unruly, a marketing technology company that has studied 430 billion video views. The findings suggested thatsuper sharers— a small group of people who share videos in the first 48 hours — kick start the viral process.But why do they do this? Unruly noticed 10 motivators for sharing videos online.

What a Viral Video Looks Like
Viral videos evoke strong emotions which compel viewers to share them with their own networks. They have the potential to reach a massive audience within hours or even minutes after being posted!
But viral content doesn't need to have a specific 'look' to attract views. Oftentimes, this is what a viral video looks like on YouTube:
The important thing to notice here is the sheer difference between views and subscribers related to this video. This disparity means that the audience chose to watch the video for its content and not just the person behind it.
How to Make a YouTube Video Go Viral
Creating a viral video takes more than luck, as YouTube educatorSean Cannell has explained. It's more like cooking. Some ingredients are nice to have, but you can only mimic a dish when you have the main ingredients.
Strategies for Making Your Videos Go Viral
Strategy 1: Creating Compelling, Shareable Videos
The first step to creating a viral video is to ensure that it is compelling and shareable. People are more likely to share content that evokes strong emotions, etc such as laughter, awe, or surprise. So, try to be entertaining, informative, or thought-provoking while keeping the video short and concise to maintain viewers' attention.
What this typically comes down to is telling a good story. Make viewers feel giggly, happy, or sad, but no matter what, make them feel something. You can even surprise them with plot twists and cliff-hangers.
Strategy 2: Leverage Social Media
Social media platforms play a crucial role in making videos go viral. With billions of users worldwide, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter offer a vast audience for your videos to be seen and shared.
To leverage social media platforms effectively, consider the following tips:
Strategy 3: Optimize Videos with SEO
Search engine optimization (SEO) is a key aspect of virality.Optimizing your videosfor search engines can increase their visibility and improve their chances of going viral. If you've been putting a lot of effort into your videos, but they aren't seeing the big numbers, you could be lacking in SEO.
To optimize your video SEO, consider the following tips:
Strategy 4: Analyze Performance and Apply New Insights
The final strategy for making your videos go viral is analyzing their performance and iterating on future content. By analyzing data such as views, engagement rates, and shares, you learn what works and what doesn't.
To analyze and iterate effectively, consider the following tips:
Going Viral Is a Skill
It’s important to understand thatidentifying your unique voice as a creatorleads to the path of virality. Authenticity is the soul of what makes a video viral; it's what makes people relate to your content and share it with others. So, be yourself and let your unique personality shine through.
Creating a viral video might seem like finding a needle in a haystack, but it's not an impossible task. So, fellow creators, take heart. Your viral moment could be just around the corner, waiting for you to seize it!

Title: Creating Global Content: 4 Tips to Get YouTube Views Worldwide

Creating Global Content: 4 Tips to Get YouTube Views Worldwide
We all know that YouTube views are the fuel that keeps every channel running smoothly. But what if we told you that focusing on a specific number of views isn’t the best way to succeed? What if, instead, you trackedwhere your views come from?
For example, do you have viewers in India? China? The Netherlands? Brazil? Because that would certainly help to grow your YouTube channel!
You would also have an easier time going viral or evengaining enough watch time to get monetized— all because you have more viewers in several locations.

So, in this post, we’ll teach you how to getglobal YouTube views. That way, you’re not depending on viewers from your continent or even the region you live in. You can build a global audience!
1. Use Music that's Trending Globally
A big reason to incorporate music in your videos — rap, rock, or otherwise — is that music makes your contentdiscoverable(especially Shorts). YouTube has thousands of music pages, and they have two important things:
Want to become a global creator?Try to get featured on these pages. Add relevant songs to your Shorts so you have a shot at appearing on a music page that any viewer can visit.
But remember, not every song will help you go viral. You want something that’s trending worldwide, so pick your tunes from a global music chart:
2. Create No-Dialogue Videos (ASMR, Animations, etc.)
Not talkingin your videos is a powerful way to reach people around the world. It sounds counterintuitive, but going silent removes the language barrier so anyone can understand your content.
Plenty of creators use this hack to go viral, butJake Fellmanis arguably the best. He got 18 million subscribers by posting animations with no dialogue — just a brief storyline and awesome music. Because there's no language to process, the videos are accessible toeveryone.
Check out his best Short, “Among Usin HD - Stomp Loop.” It has519 million viewsand 7 million likes, proving the magic of no dialogue!
3. Focus on Hot Topics
If you want global YouTube views, it helps to focus on a global concern. What do people cherish most in their lives (regardless of race, religion, and ethnicity)? What type of videos will address those desires?
Here’s a hint: New Year’s resolutions. Every year, people celebrate the coming of a new year by vowing to change one area of their lives. Many resolutions are common, though, so it’s easy to know what people are obsessed with globally.
According to Google,there were six global resolutions in 2012:
Not much has changed 11 years later. Relationships, money, and health are still popular topics on YouTube!
Pursue justoneof these, and watch how easy it becomes to get more views.
4. Add Multi-Language Audio or Subtitles to Your Videos
Remember how we saidnot talkingin videos can help you go viral? That’s 100% true, and we’ve seen it happen with superstars likeKhaby Lame! But we also know that some channels need dialogue, so eliminating it altogether isn’t realistic. That’s where multi-language audio and subtitles can help you out.
Multi-Language Subtitles
Subtitles are used to translate captions into various languages, such as French, Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, and more. So if you’re noticing a rise in viewership from different countries, figure out which languages they speak. Then you can make the right subtitles for those viewers!
You can do this by heading to theYouTube Studioand following this path:
1. ClickAnalyticsin the YouTube Studio menu.
2. Click theAudienceTab.
3. Scroll down toTop subtitle/CC languages. Here you’ll see the top languages on your channel.
As an example, vidIQ viewers choose to read subtitles in English, Arabic, and Indonesian. So we use YouTube’s auto-generated language transcripts for our videos (in the languages above). But if you aren’t satisfied with the automatic subtitles from YouTube, let the professionals atRevtranscribe your audio into accurate subtitles.
4. Next, add the subtitles to your video. You can do this by clickingSubtitlesin the YouTube Studio menu, using the search bar to find the video in question, then clickingAdd Languageon the next screen.
Multi-Language Audio
YouTube also has amulti-language audio featurethat’s slowly rolling out to more creators. If you have this feature, it allows you to upload additional languages as audio tracks for new or published videos. The only drawback is that YouTube won't generate this audio for you. You have to produce it yourself by either recording a dubbed version in the new language or hiring someone else to do it.
This video from Creator Insider has all the details. Give it a watch to learn more about multi-language audio and how to expand your views on YouTube.
And in the meantime, learn the secret to standing out as a small YouTube creator!

Title: Shorts, Longs, and Lives: How to Compare YouTube Views from All 3

Shorts, Longs, and Lives: How to Compare YouTube Views from All 3
Which type of YouTuber are you: the one who embraces every content type or the one who prefers a single video format? If you silently answered,Every content type, we're guessing your channel is pretty diverse! You probably make all of the following:
In other words, you're awell-rounded creator. You boldly go where most creators haven't gone (shamelessStar Trekplug) and are always up for a challenge. It's a great quality to have because the more you experiment on YouTube, the more likely you are to find what works for you.
But with all that content-making, you now havemore videos to analyzeand track performance for. After all, it's normal to wonder how everything competes with each other!

For example, how many people watch your livestreams versus your regular videos (sometimes we call these "longs" since they're compared side-by-side to Shorts)? Or, curiously, what percentage of viewers watch your Shorts compared with your lives?
YouTube's Viewership Panel for Shorts, Longs, and Lives
To help you out, YouTube has released a new panel calledviewers across formats. It compares your viewership across all video types, including YouTube Shorts, long-form videos, and livestreams. Notably, this panel only tracks data for returning viewers, not those who never came back to your channel.
If you click through the uppermost tabs, you're able to compare viewership on:
The breakdown is in percentages, so you get a bird's-eye view of what's happening on your channel. And for each comparison, you can see the percentage of people who watchboth content types.
Finding the 'Viewers Across Formats' Panel
1. Go to the YouTube Studio and clickAnalyticsin the left navigation bar.
2. Select theContenttab.
3. Scroll down until you seeViewers Across Formatson the right side of the screen. You'll notice that it only shows data from the last 28 days.
Why You Need This Data
Knowing the percentage of people who watch your Shorts, longs, and lives reveals what you do best on YouTube. It also shines a light on the following:
For example, here's what our viewership looks like on the vidIQ channel:
You'll notice that ourmost popular contentis regular videos first, then Shorts, and finally, livestreams.
Opportunities for Cross Promotion
Our Shorts and longs have the mostchemistry, as26%of viewers watch both content types. Since many people are interested in both, we have an opportunity to cross-promote each type and boost their collective views.
Read more:Promote Your YouTube Channel - 17 Tips for Small Creators
So, how does it work? If you want to cross-promote on your own channel, build a bridge between your short and long-form content.
One strategy is to recommend a long-form video in the description or comment section of every YouTube Short. If you're using the comment section to do this,pin your messageto the top so everyone sees your recommended video link. If you want to use the description area, use a call to actioninside of your videoto drive viewers to that section.
Want another strategy that works? Make Shorts and longs that complement each other!
For example, imagine that you've just filmed a video about traveling on a budget. In either the comment section or description area, you could recommend a Short that offers a "checklist" for budget travelers. Remember, you'll get more views if both videos are related yet contain new information!
Content That's Not Relevant (Or Needs Work)
If one content type is struggling on your channel, it doesn'talwaysmean you should stop creating it. In our case, people don't watch our livestreams nearly as much as the Shorts and longs on our channel. But our livestreams are valuable in their own way! We give free channel audits to small creators, sothe overall impact is greater than the views we receive.
On your channel, you might decide that your low-performing content just isn't worth the effort. In that case, dropping those videos could help you focus on the ones thatdowork.
The Perfect Scenario
What would your viewership look like if you hadthe perfect YouTube channel?
No such thing exists, but if it did, it would look something like this:
For any content comparison, 100% of viewers would happily watch both video types. Sounds amazing, right?
One way to come close to this scenario is by speaking to the same target audience in your videos. Whether you create longs, Shorts, or lives, have a core message that appeals to one group of people!
Narrow Your Channel's Focus
With this new panel, YouTube reveals what your viewers gravitate toward the most: your Shorts, your longs, or your lives. With that information, you can narrow your focus quite a bit. After all, maybe you don't need to go after every type of content on YouTube; perhaps one or two will do the trick.
No matter what you decide, we'll help you get views onany YouTube video. Check out the links below for more guidance!

Title: 3 Mistakes to Avoid if You Have a Small YouTube Channel

3 Mistakes to Avoid if You Have a Small YouTube Channel
As a small creator, you’ll quickly learn thatYouTube is not easy. At this point, you’re probably facing the biggest challenge, which is struggling to get views when no one knows who you are.
But don’t worry: You can beat the odds with a little advice and hard work. The first step is understanding the most common YouTube mistakes. With that information, you can fix costly errors and focus ongrowing your channel.
Fortunately, Dan Carson, senior executive producer at vidIQ, knows how to grow a small channel. In the video below, he lists the top mistakes holding creators back (and how to fix them).

But if you want a quick summary of all the tips, keep reading to see what’s stalling your progress.
1. Believing YouTube Owes You Views and Subscribers
Wouldn’t it be great if YouTube rewarded every channel equally? In that case, you could relax while collecting hundreds of views and subscribers, even if your videos don’t engage anyone. You would simply press publish and wait for good things to happen.
That’s not how YouTube works, of course. But many creators wish itcouldwork this way.
So the first mistakeis believing YouTube owes you any form of success. While it’s time-consuming to research,write scripts, shoot videos, and edit a bunch of clips together, Dan says that’s the cost of becoming a successful YouTuber. All of that experience builds you up to make better content!
2. Ignoring the Power of First Impressions
They say first impressions are everything, and that’s also true for YouTube videos. After all, viewers don't click on the first video they see;theylook at many titles and thumbnailsbefore finding something interesting to watch. And there's a lot competition!
For example, what happens when you compare these thumbnails forone second?Which of the two is more appealing, and which one is easier to understand?
Now imagine that each viewer is going throughthat same process on YouTube.How would you tweak your thumbnails to help them notice your content first?
Read more:12 Types of YouTube Thumbnails People Love to Click On
So whatever time you spend on titles and thumbnails,Dan recommends doubling it. You may have a small channelnow, but you can grow it by “decorating” your videos correctly.
3. Not Enhancing the First 30 Seconds of a Video
After the first 30 seconds, many people abandon the video they’re watching in search of a new one. But don’t panic!This is a common and well-known habit on YouTube.
Just look at the retention graph for most YouTube videos. You’ll notice the viewership line falls sharply after 30 seconds and keeps declining.
You can’t stop this 100%, but you can slow it down by getting to the point faster. Think about it this way: You’ve already sold viewers on the value of your content with a compelling title and thumbnail. Now all you need to do isdeliver that value.
But the other stuff — asking viewers to subscribe, introducing yourself — should come at the end, not the beginning, Dan clarifies. This allows you to give people what they want up-front, which is whatever you promised in the title and thumbnail.
Giving people what they want ASAP typically leads tomore watch time. That sends a positive signal to the YouTube algorithm, which means the system couldrecommend your contentto more people. Eventually, that gives you a shot at more YouTube views!
How to Fix These Small YouTuber Mistakes
If you’ve made a few mistakes on your channel, remember it’s never too late to turn things around. Embrace the lessons, then chart a new course of action!
Here are five things you can do right now:
Have you fixed these basic mistakes on your channel? That means you're ready for the next step:using emotional triggers to get more views!

Title: 18 Viral Video Hooks for YouTube Shorts [Proven Hacks]

18 Viral Video Hooks for YouTube Shorts [Proven Hacks]
Did you know that the right video introduction canmake your YouTube Short go viral? It’s true. We call these "hooks" in the YouTube world, and they have the power to grab viewers' attention in the first three seconds.The reason you'd want to grab someone's attention, especially with a Short, is tostop them from swipingto the next video. Swiping away has a negative effect on your content and stops you from going explosively viral.
There isn't much research about Shorts and their performance, but one study adds some clarity. Paddy Galloway discovered that the best-performing Shorts have 70% of people viewing them versus swiping away from them.
To keep viewers engaged, you need an intro that propels them from one scene to the next. Here are 18 viral hooks to help you out!

1. “Have You Heard About..?”
As an opening line, “have you heard about” creates a healthy dose of FOMO on YouTube, which stands for "fear of missing out." No one likes to be excluded, so this hook summons a viewer’s natural curiosity.
For example, have you heard aboutSean Andrew(see what we did there? 😉) In the Short below, he immediately asks, “Have you heard about the world’s loneliest toilet?” Most people would say no, and that alone propels them to watch the video. It has over13 million views!
Other variations of this hook:
2. “They Don’t Want You to Know This Secret…”
This hook has enticing qualities, all of which can make a Short go viral in no time. It's got conspiracy, intrigue, and an “us versus them” dynamic happening all at once. As long as you don't use bad clickbait, this hook should get you more YouTube views.
Want proof?Techraniumgot14 million viewsafter claiming that “Apple doesn’t want people to know” about this password hack for iPhones:
3. “You’ve Never Seen Anything Like This…”
This hook is a straight-up challenge for your audience. You’re asking them to prove whether they know a random fact or not, which sort of feels like a game! It's as if they've been called out, and now they have to answer the call by watching your video.
Mrwhosethebossgot over3 million viewswith this hook. He claims that viewers have “never seen a pair of headphones like the HHOGene GPods,” and he may be right. Millions of people stuck around to see what all the hype was about.
4. “I Never Do THIS, and Here’s Why…”
When someone says theyneverdo something, they’re about to share an unpopular opinion. This can be intriguing on YouTube, as many creators repeat the same ideas and beliefs they've heard elsewhere!
Nas Dailyhas a popular Short using this magic phrase. In it,Dear Alynesays, “I never buy silk, and this is the strange reason why.” The intro must have worked because the video has over22 million views.
Other variations of this hook:
5. “This Is the Best Product I’ve Ever Used…”
In just a few words, this hook tells us a valuable recommendation is on the way — maybe even for a life-changing product. But viewers have to keep watching until the product is revealed, making this excellent hook forboosting your Shorts views.
Here’s another example from Mrwhosetheboss. He opens the video by saying, “This is the most powerful charger I’ve ever laid hands on.” Instinctively, you want to keep watching to see which charger he’s talking about. The video has2.4 million views!
6. “I Was ‘Today Years Old’ When I Found This Out…”
"I was today years old" is a humorous way to reveal something you just learned. Maybe you didn’t know a drink tote from Chik-fil-aholds six beverages instead of four. Perhaps you just realized Ritz crackers haveserrated edges for cutting cheese.
Starting a video with this phrase helps you establish common ground and shows that you’re learning alongside the viewer. It’s no wonder a creator likeBentellectgot6 million viewsexplaining that “news” is an acronym (Notable Events, Weather and Sport).
7. “Questions I Get Asked a Lot…”
Do viewers ask you the same questions repeatedly? The next time you make a Short, kick off the video by saying, “Questions I get asked a lot." This implies that you have something relevant to say, and viewers should stick around to hear it.
For example,Hwaniieegot5 million viewsanswering questions about his experience as a male nurse.
8. “I Asked Google…”
This phrase should catch anyone's attention because most people use Google in 2023. Plus, the phrase “I asked Google” brings so many questions to mind. What did the person search for? What did the results say? Did they learn something funny, shocking, or interesting?
Sean Andrew used this opener to get400,000 viewson a long-jumping video. He asked Google “what the longest jump in history is,” and then attempted to break the long-jump record.
9. “Three Things I Do Before…”
Sometimes, you just can’t beat practicality. If you have a how-to channel, “three things I do before” is the hook you need to provide value and solve problems for your audience.
One example isErika Kullberg’s“Quick Travel Tips.” She starts out by saying, “Here are three things I do before every flight, coming from a lawyer who travels six months out of the year.” She speaksdirectlyto travelers and builds credibility by saying how often she travels.
10. “Try This to [Accomplish Goal]...”
“Try this” is a typical call to action on YouTube. It catches a viewer’s attention because the phrase empowers them to learn something new.
For example,KeeanSocialintrigued500,000 peopleby simply saying, “Try this to get more views on your next YouTube Short.” It’s quick, simple, and works wonders for grabbing attention.
11. “Did You Know That..?”
This hook has an element of surprise, which works well for captivating viewers in the first three seconds. But more than that, it promises a rare piece of knowledge you can’t get if you swipe away!
This intro worked well for Nas Daily, who asked a simple question: “Did you know this book is poisonous?” The Short was so intriguing that it got over22 million views.
12. “X vs. Y…”
Don’t worry, we’re not talking about math here. “X versus Y” refers to a “this or that” scenario, where you compare two things to see which one is better. Viewers love this intro because it sparks competition.
Again, Mrwhosetheboss sets a great example here. He asks, “The thickest phone case or the thinnest phone case: Which is actually better?”16 million peoplecouldn’t resist this two-second experiment!
13. “How to Create…”
The value of this hook just can’t be overstated! With three little words, you convince viewers you’re about to solve a problem, teach a skill, and empower them to accomplish their goals.
If you think “how to” content is severely overdone on YouTube, think again. Creators likeLydia Tomlinsonare getting over600,000 viewswith openers like “how to create festive outfits.”
Another variation of this hook is “how to do [virtually anything]...”
14. “I’m Trying This So You Don’t Have To…”
Who doesn’t love a little risk and adventure on YouTube? When you try something bold (so others don't have to), that pretty much makes you a hero! It’s also entertaining to watch a creator set up a challenge, react to it, and share the results.
Once again, Sean Andrew got people’s attention with this creative hook. He tried to survive Chinese water torture and ended up getting6 million views.
Other variations of this hook:
15. “The Top 3 [Items/Ideas]...”
You guessed it: This hook is a variation of the almighty listicle video. Use it to recommend the best vacation spot, indoor vacuum, dog breed, or whatever’s close to your heart! People love this hook because they know they’re about to getreal value.
And here’s a vidIQ example for you: “top three YouTube mistakes.”
16. “How to Become a…”
Typically, this hook is reserved for serious pursuits, like becoming a fisherman or a doctor. But if you want, you can be a complete goofball and turn this hook into comedic gold.
That’s whatim_sioweidid in the Short below. She opens it up with “how to become a mermaid in three steps,” and then9 million peoplewatched her take the most ridiculous journey to the sea.
17. “How to Have the Best [Activity/Idea] of Your Life…”
Most people want to do something better, faster, or easier in their daily lives. So opening your Short with “here’s how to have the best [insert common goal]” makes people pay attention to what you’re saying.
For example,Mr.Psychologyreposted a video ofonlyjayustelling people how to have the best sleep ever. The Short has over500,000 views!
18. “A Simple Hack to…”
This hook is similar to the previous one, except it’s even better. While you can show someone how to do something thoroughly, providing a shortcut really gets their attention.
We used a variation of this hook recently, stating, “This could get your YouTube Shorts a lot more views.”
Just don’t give away the juicy part too soon!
Make Sure the Hook Lives Up to its Hype
While these hooks are attention-grabbing, remember that a video should always deliver on its promise. No matter what you say or do in the first three seconds, the remaining 30-50 seconds should build upon that foundation.
But crafting a good hook is just one way to go viral.Here are more characteristics of viral YouTube Shorts!

Getting YouTube views is always challenging, but it’s a lot easier when you speak to a viewer’s heart. What are their fears? Which memories transport them to a simpler time? How do other people affect their decisions?
Most people have deep,emotional triggers, and YouTube viewers are no exception. Depending on the content you show them, emotions like anger, fear, and curiosity simmer in their minds.
But why is this important? Research shows thatemotionally-charged videos are twice as likely to be sharedthan those with weak emotional cues. So if you want more views on YouTube, start craftingdynamiccontent.

These six emotional triggers will give you a head start!
1. Nostalgia
Most people get nostalgic a few times each month. As a YouTube creator, you can harness this phenomenon by making “throwback” content that speaks to your audience’s past. Nostalgic memories like riding a bike, eating McDonald’s for the first time, or playing on a hot summer day will connect viewers with their youth (and your YouTube channel!).
This strategy works well because, surprisingly, most people aren’t looking to the future. A study by YouGov and the7stars found that55% of people would rather return to the pastthan skip ahead to the unknown (28%).
And we can see that on YouTube. Channels likeREACTare pulling in massive views (over 100,000) with videos like “Gen Z Tries 90s ‘As Seen On TV’ Products.”
2. Novelty
The science behind novelty is intriguing yet pretty straightforward. During a novel experience,people focus more on different stimuli, such as sights, smells, sounds, and temperature changes.
Of course, YouTube is all about sight and sound. So if your viewers “see” and “hear” your unique video — and it’s novel enough to stand out — you can make viewers watch for longer. This increase in watch time may influencethe algorithmto share your content with more people.
To take advantage of this hack, createrare, odd, or unusualvideos on YouTube.
A good example is “100 Most Rare People in the World” byPrestonReacts. It’s quirky, unexpected, and has1.5 million views!
3. Curiosity
For many viewers, boredom is the number one reason they seek entertainment. But getting people to click onyourvideos — and not some other creator’s — is easier said than done. There are billions of videos to choose from, and people click on whatfeeds their curiositythe most.
Making curious content is a tricky art form. It involves using powerful words like “secret” and “discover” to build tempting video titles. You also need an excellent thumbnail to reinforce the video’s mystery.
Need some inspiration? Watch “Japan’s Secret Island Where People Never Die” byYes Theory. The first three seconds are filled withcurious vibes, as the speaker asks, "What do the longest-living humans on the planet know that we don’t?"
With over700,000 views, you can bet people stuck around to find out.
4. Fear and Anger
Did you know that fear and anger lead to more "social sharing" online?
For example, imagine watching a video that makes you red with anger; because you're hot and heated, you're more likely to share it with people who may feel the same. In fact, that’swhy people share stories, news, and information with others.
The same thing happens on YouTube. While being scared or angry isn’t the best feeling, viewers hit “share” to bring others into the conversation. And when people share videos outside of the app/website, it creates a fast track toreal YouTube views.
For example, CNBC makes polarizing videos that stir up a lot of emotions. One of those videos is called “Why Tipping Is so Out of Control in the U.S."
So many people were disgruntled by the tipping fiasco that viewers started sharing the video on Reddit. It now has 23,600 upvotes and 8,086 comments.
And the video itself? Thanks to social sharing, it has over2 million views.
5. Scarcity
Depending on your YouTube niche, you can usescarcityto drive more views to your channel. It’s one of theeasieststrategies to pull off, especially when discussing a limited resource that everyone needs.
There are a few different types of scarcity: time-based, supply-based, and demand-based. According to one study,supply-based scarcityaffects decision-making the most and garners more attention. So if you’re discussing anything that feels “out of stock” right now, you could boost your YouTube views by leading with that fact.
Some of those things are:
But time-based scarcity works too. Notice howDorian Developsuses the scarcity of time to get1.5 million viewson his video, “It's Too Late to Get Your Life Together in Your 30s.”
6. Social Proof
As social creatures, we often look to others when making decisions for ourselves. Should someone switch careers at 30 to get a higher-paying job? Is visiting Disneyland worth the hundreds of dollars it costs? It’s easy (and safer) to get the answer through someone else’s experience.
So, how does this work on YouTube? Overall, social proof builds trust and credibility with viewers. When your title and thumbnail show that you’ve accomplished something big (with evidence to back it up), people may view you as a trusted source. From there, the clicks roll in.
For example, watch the video below, “How I Became a Millionaire at 23.” Right off the bat, the title tells usJ Richhas first-hand experience with money generation. He’s not just repeating what others have said, and he proves that becoming a millionaire is possible — maybe evenadvisable.
Also, the thumbnail reassures us that the story comes “with proof!” And that’s one reason the video has over500,000 views.
Emotional Content = Free YouTube Views
With these emotional triggers, you never have to worry about buying YouTube views or spamming people to go viral. Viewers will connect with your videos because they’re honest, vulnerable, and human.
But you can always learn more on YouTube. For example, there are ways to analyze your audience on a deep, psychological level — and you should know them if you want high-retention YouTube views!
Here’s how to build a persona for your audience and get more views.

Just keep reading. We’ll show you the most popular questions asked by creators and how our AI Coach responded. You’re about to learna lotabout YouTube growth!
1. “What type of YouTube channel should I create?”
AI Coach:The type of channel you should create depends on what you're passionate about and what content you will enjoy creating and sharing. Think about what topics you're interested in and would enjoy learning more about or talking about.
Additionally, consider what type of content you would like to make and what value it can give to your audience. Once you have an idea about the focus of your channel, consider the types of content you can create, like tutorials, reviews, interviews, vlogs, tips & tricks, and how-to videos.

2. “Should I cover multiple topics on one channel or explore each topic on separate channels?”
AI Coach:That's an interesting question! It really depends on what your overall goal is. For example, if your goal is to grow a broad audience and have a variety of topics covered in your content, then it may help to cover multiple niche markets in one channel. If you want to focus on a specific market and build a strong brand presence, then creating branded channels for your content might be the better route.
Having a separate channel gives you the opportunity to create a clear brand identity and focus on the niche audience you are catering to. Additionally, you can use cross-promotion to draw viewers from one channel to the other and vice versa. However, it will be up to you to experiment and see which strategy works best for your channel.
3. “What are YouTube keywords? Why do I need them?”
AI Coach:YouTube keywords are words and phrases related to your content that viewers are using to find your videos. It's important to find the right keywords and to include them throughout your video titles, descriptions, tags, and other metadata so that your videos show up in the right searches.

4. “Do keywords matter for YouTube Shorts?”
AI Coach:Absolutely. Just like any other type of video, keywords play an important role in YouTube Shorts discovery. Optimizing your keywords will make sure that your videos appear in the right search results, allowing you to reach more viewers and build your channel. To get the most out of keywords, choose ones that are related to the topic of your video and use them throughout the video title, description, and tags.
5. “Tell me some tricks about the YouTube algorithm?”
AI Coach:A few tips on understanding the YouTube algorithm:

6. “My videos used to get thousands of views and now they don't. Why?”
AI Coach:It's possible that your videos no longer get thousands of views because the landscape of YouTube has changed. Over time, YouTube's algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated, meaning that viewers are now seeing more personalized recommendations based on their interests and past viewing history.
In order to increase the number of views your videos are getting, it's important to stay on top of trends and create content that is relevant to what's popular right now. Additionally, optimizing your titles, thumbnails, descriptions, and tags can help ensure that your videos are being recommended to the right viewers.

7. "Will I get more views by uploading more videos?"
AI Coach: Absolutely! Creating regularly scheduled videos can help you gain more reach by providing consistent content for viewers, which can increase your subscribers. It will also help you maximize your discoverability on YouTube, as the algorithm favors channels that upload frequently and have a large selection of videos.
Additionally, creating regularly scheduled videos will help you build an audience since viewers will know when to expect your content.
8. “How do I make my YouTube Shorts go viral?”
AI Coach:To make a YouTube Short go viral, you need to focus on creating a video that is engaging and attention-grabbing for viewers. Make sure you start your video with an interesting hook that will make viewers want to watch more. Optimize your video by using the right keywords in your title and description so viewers can easily find it. Share your video on other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, and also considercollaborating with other creatorswho have a similar audience.
Finally, create a compelling thumbnail that will draw people in and engage with your audience as much as possible.

9. “What kind of YouTube Shorts can I create in 10 minutes?”
AI Coach:Here are a few ideas for YouTube Shorts content that you can do in 10 minutes:

10. “I want to monetize my channel with either Shorts or long-form videos. Which requirement is easier to satisfy for the YouTube Partner Program: 10 million Shorts views or 4,000 watch hours?”
AI Coach:In terms of difficulty, 10 million Shorts views is generally easier to achieve than 4,000 watch hours. To reach 10 million Shorts views, you'll need to create content that is short and engaging, with a focus on optimizing for algorithms and trends. Whereas for 4,000 watch hours, you'll need to produce more longer-form content that is watched for longer periods of time by your audience. This requires more strategic planning and creative ideas to keep viewers engaged.

11. “What is the best time to upload a YouTube video?”
AI Coach:The best time to upload a video is going to depend on your target audience and the type of video you're producing. Generally, the most successful YouTube videos are uploaded during peak hours for your target demographic and time zone.
It's also important to take into account which day of the week the video will be posted, as certain days tend to generate more viewings.
Finally, the topic of the video should be taken into consideration when determining the best time to upload. For example, if you're creating content related to current events, it would be more beneficial to post the video when that topic is trending.

12. “How can I reach more subscribers on my YouTube channel?”
AI Coach:As with any online platform, having a strong foundation is key to success, and YouTube is no different. Here are some tips to help you reach more subscribers on YouTube:
13. “What is the optimal video length?”
AI Coach:The optimal video length really depends on the content that you want to share and the goal you have for your channel. Generally, you'll want to keep your videos around five minutes or less so that viewers won't lose interest. However, if you're creating a video series or a tutorial, then you'll want to create longer videos that cover all the necessary information.
14. “How do I get more impressions on each video so more people see my content?”
AI Coach:Getting impressions on your YouTube channel is all about optimizing your videos for discoverability and visibility. To do that, you need to create a good title and thumbnail for each video, which should grab attention and encourage people to click.
You also need to make sure the keywords you use in your titles and descriptions are relevant to your content and help YouTube's algorithm find your videos in search. Additionally, consider connecting with other creators in your niche and building relationships with potential viewers. This will help get your videos seen by more people and boost your impressions.

15. “My titles and thumbnails are really good, but my YouTube videos aren't doing well. Why won’t the algorithm promote my content?”
AI Coach:I understand how frustrating it can be when your videos don't seem to be performing as well as you'd like, even when you know yourthumbnailsandtitlesare good. This could be due to a variety of factors, from not optimizing your content for the algorithm to not having enough engaging content.
I recommend taking a look at your videos and asking yourself if there is anything that could be improved. It could be something like creating more engaging content, optimizing for the algorithm, or even just creating better thumbnails and titles. If you need more help, you can always reach out to me and I'll be happy to help!
16. “How can I encourage people to watch my videos for longer?”
AI Coach:Great question. Retention is key to successful growth on YouTube, so it's worth investing some time in this. One of the best ways to increase retention is to create content that is relevant and engaging to your target audience.
You can also optimize existing videos, add intro “hooks” to keep viewers engaged, create playlists to keep viewers watching, use annotations or cards to push viewers to other related videos, etc.

17. “Where is the best place to ask people to subscribe within my videos?”
AI Coach:The best and most effective place to ask viewers to subscribe is at the end of your videos, preferably on an end screen. A call to action, such as, "If you enjoyed this video, please don't forget to hit the subscribe button and join our family" or "If you liked what you saw, please subscribe to join us," can be added to the end screen of your videos.
It’s also a good idea to add a subscribe link in the description box of your videos so that it is easily accessible to viewers who might not see the end screen.

AI Coach:There are many ways to promote your YouTube channel, so it can be a bit overwhelming to decide which ones to focus on. Here are the main strategies I recommend for promoting your channel:

Title: How to Grow Your YouTube Channel in 2023: The Ultimate Guide

How to Grow Your YouTube Channel in 2023: The Ultimate Guide
Starting a YouTube channel is tough, but growing it to thousands of subscribers — or even millions — is  much harder to pull off. Some may wonder if it's even possible anymore.
But if you want to restore your faith, take a look around YouTube. There'sRyan Trahan(12 million subscribers) and the infamousMrBeast(136 million subscribers). You might even run intoSSSniperwolf, who has 33.1 million supporters. It becomes astonishingly clear that growing a large audience is not impossible.
So, how did they do it? What are the steps to grow a successful YouTube channel?

If you want to go from zero to content hero, keep scrolling until you reach the end. We're going to tell you the best ways to grow on YouTube!
1. Create High-Quality Videos
Standing out on YouTube is tough, but anything's possible if you focus on making unique, high-quality videos. By high quality, we don't mean having the best camera, lighting, or video backdrop. The best videos come from creators who study their audienceandthe art ofYouTube storytelling.
This skill doesn't come overnight, but you'll know it's there when you can make viewers feel something at the end of a video — inspired, motivated, curious, slightly tickled. Shifting their mood from one state to another means you're wielding true influence (the kind that makes people hit subscribe and turn on post notifications).
So how do you pull this off? You can start by learning what makes a video engaging, such as:
2. Optimize Your Content for Search Engines
Did you know thatYouTube is the second-largest search enginebehind Google? Creators upload over 500 hours of video daily, and YouTube tries to deliver it all to the right viewers.
Want YouTube to recommendyourvideos to more people? Help them out by optimizing your content for maximum reach!
Here's the only checklist you'll ever need when it comes tooptimizing videos on YouTube:
When you use the right keywords, you can also show up on Google search pages. That's a lot of free promotion for your channel!
3. Design Attention-Grabbing Thumbnails
If you want to grow on YouTube, don't underestimate the power of custom thumbnails. Each one is like a colorful billboard advertising your video's "juicier" parts. The more intriguing those images look, the more inclined viewers are to click on your content!
There are plenty of ways to create good thumbnails, such as:
Need design ideas?Here are 12 thumbnails people love to click on YouTube.
4. Write Engaging YouTube Titles and Descriptions
With YouTube titles, you want to get in the habit of writing for emotion and not just describing the video. This is important because viewers are interested in more than "the topic" at hand. Plenty of videos on YouTube cover the same theme; the real question is, why should people care aboutoneparticular video?
The answer, once again, is emotion.A great titletaps into the viewer's deepest fears and desires. It promises to change your life in 30 days with a new workout routine, or it scares you into pulling all your money out of the stock market. Either way, an enticing title makes you want to click it.
But if you need inspiration (and a nice break),this AI tool can write titles for you!
And once you have a good title, focus on the video description. There are no tricks here because, at minimum, all you have to do is describe the video accurately.
Of course, you can take it to another level by ensuring your description has these 10 ingredients.
5. Use Hashtags to Boost Your Reach
Adding hashtags to your YouTube video helps more people discover it, so tagging your content is always a good idea. Like most social media sites, the hashtags on YouTube are 100% clickable. That means a viewer can tap any hashtag and find themselves on a page showing thousands of videos related to a topic.
As you can imagine, getting featured on a hashtag page leads to more exposure for your channel! If you spend some time researching the best hashtag pages — ones that are popular but not flooded with millions of videos — you can grow your YouTube channel by attracting more clicks.
When you're ready, go to your video title or description. Type the # symbol followed by the descriptor of your choice!
6. Boost Your Engagement with a Call to Action
Wouldn't it be nice if most viewers…
All of this engagement leads to more channel growth, but most viewers don't think about completing those actions. After all, they're too busy watching videos and exploring new content! To keep building your fanbase, ask viewers to like, comment, and subscribe at the end of every video.
7. Build a Strong Relationship with Your Audience
It's hard to grow a channel if you aren't connecting with your viewers, so always find time to be social on YouTube. You can start by responding to video comments or take it up a notch by hosting live stream Q&A's. Creating polls on the YouTube Community tab will also help you learn viewers' likes, dislikes, and behaviors.
Engaging with your audience isn't too different from hanging out with a friend. All you have to do is get to know who they are!
8. Invest in YouTube Collaborations
YouTube collaborationsare a brilliant way to grow your channel by introducing new viewers to your content. But of course, not all collabs are successful. You have to find the right partners, make sure your audiences overlap, and do other things to make the project work.
Here are a few ways to execute the best YouTube collab:
9. Capitalize on YouTube Trends and Challenges
To speed up your channel's growth, why not participate in YouTube challenges or a couple of social media trends? This approach works for small YouTube creators — especially those looking to grow sooner rather than later.
However, exercise caution when choosing different trends to hop on. Some will be a poor match for your channel's focus, making it difficult to turn casual viewers into devoted followers. Additionally, some challenges may risk your safety, like the viral yet highly dangerousmilk crate challenge.
But everyone has to start somewhere, right?Use this guide to find trending topics for your videos, then ask yourself one question before settling on an idea: Does this help or hurt my channel long-term?
10. Build a 'Bridge' Between Short and Long-Form Content
Last year, YouTube announced it would build a bridge between YouTube Shorts and traditional, long-form videos. Notably, the platform vowed to change how it recommends content, making sure that longer videos are suggested alongside Shorts.
In other words, YouTube is analyzing Shorts viewership on all channels. Suppose a particular Short is getting massive views or engagement. In that case, the platform may recommend long-form content from the same creator!
So what does that mean for your channel's growth? Overall, it proves that YouTube Shorts are now a bridge connecting some viewers to your long-form videos. So by posting Shorts, you have a real shot at promoting the rest of your content!
Of course, this all depends on how your Shorts peform.So here's a helpful guide for increasing the Shorts views on your channel.
11. Cross-Promote Your Videos
Promoting videos on YouTube is not difficult at all, so you should definitely do it to grow your YouTube channel quickly. There are plenty of ways to promote your videos, such as:
If you aren't familiar with cards and end screens, the main distinction is that one appears during a YouTube video, and one shows up at the end. You can place cards throughout a video to suggest additional content, but end screens are only active in the last 5-20 seconds. If you're using an end screen, try to suggest one video only (not two or three) so viewers don't spend too much time making a decision (and give up from being overwhelmed).
For a full guide, read our 17-step checklist for promoting your YouTube channel.
12. Create YouTube Playlists
When it comes to growing a YouTube channel fast, many content creators overlook the power of playlists. Many see them as a "holding place" for multiple videos, but it's much deeper than that.
YouTube playlists bring a sense of order to your channel. They organize your content so it's easier for viewers to browse your videos and find something interesting. On top of that, they encourage people to binge your content and bring more watch time to your channel.
And if you didn't know already, videos with high watch time have a better chance of being promoted by YouTube's algorithm (among other factors).
Do you need help creating or promoting your playlists on YouTube? This guide has you covered!
13. Host YouTube Live Streams
Earlier, we mentioned live streaming when we talked about building a relationship with viewers. So you already know that live streaming helps you connect with them through Q&A's, interactive games, and more.
But did you know that YouTube promotes live streams significantly? There's a section on the platform just for live videos, and getting featured there may not be as challenging as you think. We've seen streams with a modest number of viewers (5,000 or less) featured in the gaming section.
It's also worth noting that your live streams don't have to be flawless. You can cultivate a strong viewership by being friendly, interactive, and captivating.
14. Check Your YouTube Analytics Often
Seeing how your content performs and developing ways to improve it is the best way to grow a YouTube channel. It keeps you focused on the present and the future in equal portions, which is a good thing! You will ask yourself, "How can I make the best possible video today?" When it doesn't go so well, you'll change the question to "How can I reimagine this failed idea?"
It all begins with checking your YouTube analytics. For example, plenty of metrics will tell you if you had a lackluster intro or a subpar ending to your video. You'll even learn the rate at which people click on your content.
Here are some best stats to track for overall growth:
Read this guide to learn more about each one!
15. Post Videos Consistently
We know, we know: Everyone talks about being consistent on YouTube. But that's because itreally candictate your views, subscribers, and engagement. After all, it's hard to grow your channel if you're not showing up consistently.
To stay on track, make sure you have a solidYouTube upload schedule. Then stick to it!

YouTube SEO: How to Optimize Your Videos for Maximum Views
Every creator wants to get more views on YouTube. That singular goal drives people to improve their videos in various ways, such as generating more watch time, getting a higher click-through rate, and enhancing audience retention. After all, these are the YouTube analytics you want to pay attention to because they serve as powerful ranking factors.
But as you focus on those areas, don’t forgetthe power of YouTube SEO. Once you’ve mastered theart of storytellingand understand how to get clicks, SEO is like gasoline for your content, blasting it to thousands of additional viewers on YouTube.
What is YouTube SEO?
YouTube SEO (search engine optimization) is a set of methods for optimizing content, whether that’s individual videos, playlists, or even an entire channel. The practices range from using popular keywords in your video and its metadata (such as titles and descriptions) to using hashtags that reach more viewers.

SEO is important for YouTube because it helps the recommendation system understand what a video is about. Over time, this should help the content get featured on search pages. After all, the goal of YouTube SEO is to make videos rank higher andreceive more views.
YouTube SEO Best Practices
Ready to get started? If so, it’s time to build a YouTube SEO strategy. Read the tips below for a complete optimization checklist, from enhancing titles to adding hashtags to writing video descriptions.
1. Choose a Target Keyword for Your Content
Before you can optimize your video, you have to know what keyword you’re targeting on YouTube. Most of this knowledge comes from keyword research, so once you have a topic in mind, the next step is identifying thesearch termspeople will use to find your video.
Any keyword research tool can help you with this. The best ones will show you the most important things about a keyword, such as:
From there, you can see which keywords are easier to rank for and plan your video accordingly.
For example, let’s say you want to make a video about teacakes. When you type this phrase into vidIQ’s keyword research tool, you’ll notice the term haslow competition and medium search volume.
Because competition is low and searches are fairly high, “tea cakes” will make an excellent target keyword. Few creators are exploring the topic on YouTube, butviewers are lookingfor that content every month; you can be the one to fill the gap!
Of course, that’s just the beginning of keyword research. Your target keyword could be hiding in another section of the tool, such as matching terms, related terms, or questions people ask.
So here’s a full guide for understanding YouTube keyword research!
2. Include Keywords in Your Video Title and Description
Once you have a target keyword, find a natural way to add it to your title and description.For example, if your keyword is “London train views,” use that in your title just once and make sure everything is understandable.
Compare these two titles to see the difference:
The second title confusingly over-uses the keyword. The first title is clear, informative, and intriguing!

Also, try to repeat the keyword in your video description. You can even throw in a few related keywords if you have them.
All of this will help the YouTube algorithm understand your content and display it on the right search pages, leading to a higher video ranking.
3. Make Sure the Video’s Thumbnail Reinforces the Title
Most people don’t think of thumbnails when it comes to YouTube SEO, but they’re extremely important. Thumbnails are the first thing people notice about a video — not the title, description, or how SEO-friendly those assets are. More than anything, viewers use the thumbnail to confirm the video matches their interests or offers something special.
That’s why you should always add a custom YouTube thumbnail to your videos. That way, you can design the image to reinforce the title and draw people in.
For example, let’s say you have a title that reads “Modern Billionaires versus Historical Ones: How They Spent Their Fortunes.” To reinforce the title, you might have images of Elon Musk and Henry Ford, the word “versus” nestled between them, and $100 bills scattered throughout the thumbnail.
Here’s a close example from theLifestyle of Millionaireschannel:
As you design, remember to optimize your thumbnail from a technical standpoint, too:

4. Use Hashtags to Reach More Viewers
Using YouTube hashtags is another way to optimize your video content. These clickable pieces of metadata help people find what they’re looking for on YouTube, so adding a couple to your title and description never hurts. Simply type the # symbol followed by the descriptor you want to use.
By using the right hashtag(s), your video could show up on a popularhashtag page, such as the one below for#makeupasmr. Getting featured in this lucrative part of the app or website gives your video more exposure!
The key is to research these hashtag pages ahead of time. Which ones are popular enough to boost your video but small enough that you can still get featured there?
5. Add Captions and Subtitles for Accessibility
It’s tempting to skip the entire process of adding captions, especially when you’re ready to upload. But what if we said you could miss out onthousands of viewsif you ignore this step?
This reason why is because people have different viewing experiences on YouTube. Some prefer watching videos with the sound off and reading captions instead. Others need captions 100% of the time because they can’t hear the audio. And a third group of viewers needs language-based subtitles to understand the video in their native tongue.
YouTube can help with some of this, as each video you upload comes with automatic captions. The translation technology on YouTube does most of the work; you just have to review the transcript and correct a few errors here and there.
You can also add subtitles during the video-editing process if you have a multicultural audience. For example,Tokyo Meets Brooklyncreates videos in Japanese with English subtitles and vice versa.
6. Put Your Video in a Playlist
If you want your video to get more views, one solution is to put it in a story-based playlist. Not only do playlists encourage people to binge your content, but they also help people discover your videos in the first place. After all, viewers can filter a YouTube search to show playlists only.
Want more tips?Here are eight ways to grow your channel with YouTube playlists.
7. Promote Your Video Using Cards and End Screens
Once you’ve optimized your video, promoting it within other videos on your YouTube channel is a good idea. You can do this easily with cards and end screens.
YouTube cards are clickable elements that pop up when someone’s watching a video. They’re typically used to refer people to another piece of content, which is usually related to the topic at hand. So if you want a video to get more views and exposure, make it a YouTube card in your next video!
End screensare interactive outros that appear in the last 5-20 seconds of a video. You can add many things to an end screen (subscribe button, website link, etc.), but the best option is to recommendone videoto watch next. That way, viewers click the next video without thinking too hard. This is the perfect place to give more exposure to a fully optimized video!

Save Time with a YouTube SEO Tool
Knowing the latest YouTube SEO tips will take you far, but you don’t have to become an expert. Realistically, it’s faster to use SEO tools that analyze content for you. That way, you can get back to what truly matters, like coming up with video ideas and filming content.
This is where vidIQ can help you out with acomplete SEO report. Each time you upload, this tool will analyze your video’s SEO and tell you what’s missing. There’s even a checklist to remind you of the important stuff, like adding keywords to your title, putting your video in a playlist, and adding closed captions to your content.

Title: 9 Video Ideas to Go Viral with YouTube Shorts

9 Video Ideas to Go Viral with YouTube Shorts
Why do some YouTube Shorts go viral while others don’t? If you break it down by what makes a good video, the best ones always have the following:
In this post, we’ll focus on the most critical part — creating a strong concept for your video. So if you want more views this year, here are nine YouTube Shorts ideas to go viral!
1. Tutorials
YouTube Shorts may be brief, but there’s more than enough time to squeeze in a tutorial. That could be anything you’re good at, such as DIY projects, art, tech repair, or another topic related to your niche. Just make it brief and informative!

If you need some inspiration, here’s a skin-retouching tutorial fromGrapexels. It’s pretty short, but you get a step-by-step guide on improving anyone’s skin in Adobe Photoshop. Plus, the tutorial also has more than 5 million views!
2. Life Hacks
Of all the viral YouTube Shorts ideas, life hacks may be one of the best. After all, everyone loves a shortcut to achieving their goals!
There are two ways to execute this idea on YouTube. You could react to a life hack that’s already trending, or you could film yourself attempting the hack in a brand new video. Either path could lead to a viral moment if the topic flows with your niche.
Watch this video fromLionfieldto see how it's done!
3. Before and After
Before and after videos have a strong appeal on YouTube. They're justsatisfyingin a way that most videos will never be, especially when something goes from dirty to clean or from boring to beautiful.
With these videos, just make sure the “after” looks better than the “before.” The gap between those states is what creates the “wow” factor.
Need an example? Study this video fromDIY Home Decor.
4. Quick Tips
Quick tips are like tutorials, except you have more space to play around with the format. You don’t have to go step-by-step, but you can find creative ways to break complex topics into bite-sized pieces of information.
For example,Max Klymenkoposted a Short about answering tricky interview questions. Instead of showing a list of tips, this creator mimicked an actual job interview! There are also captions to help people memorize what they’re learning.
5. Common Myths
Have you noticed any myths within your YouTube community? What about common mistakes people always make?
If so, set the record straight in a short, punchy video. Your findings may shock viewers so much that theyhaveto share the video with someone else.
For example,Davidjustinn Shortshas a video about mistakes people never catch in popular movies. It has over 7 million views!
6. Motivational Videos
Motivational content works best for people chasing popular goals, such as getting in shape, staying healthy, or adopting the right mindset. They're extremely hard to accomplish, so a little motivation goes a long way.
You can make a difference by sharing a goal you achieved over time. Show a time-lapse of your progress, or find creative ways to break down your journey and get people inspired!
Growingannanashas a great example of this, where she documented her full-body transformation in exchange for38 million views.
7. Fun Facts
Need a video idea thatneverdisappoints? You can’t go wrong with fun facts!
For this idea, you’ll expose hidden truths that appeal to a curious audience (which includes most viewers). Combine that withsuper rare facts, and you’ll go viral while entertaining millions of people.
But that’s just one side of the coin. Some facts can simply be relatable (not rare) and still get millions of views.
For example,Icycolposted a Short about actors who do the same thing in every movie. It has over 29 million views!
8. Unboxing/Reviews
Want to become a product influencer?
We have good news! You don’t have to post long videos on YouTube to start getting discovered. Many people create short, viral, unboxing videos, proving anyone can transform the idea for YouTube Shorts.
TakeMrTechCrown, for example. This creator posted an iPhone XR unboxing with more than 6 million views. Not bad for one YouTube Short!
Bonus: Repurpose Your Long-Form Content
If you have popular long-form videos, why not turn those into YouTube Shorts? You can see themost-replayed segmentof a video now, making it easier to spot popular chapters that could go viral.
Once you find that special clip, it’s just a matter of “dressing it up.” Add music, captions, and special effects, then give it a title people can’t ignore. All of this helps you go viral on YouTube!
Need more guidance? Here's a video explaining all nine of the Shorts ideas we mentioned above.
Now that you have some video ideas, it’s time for the next step:getting more views on your Shorts!

Title: A Simple Trick to Make Viewers Watch Multiple YouTube Videos

A Simple Trick to Make Viewers Watch Multiple YouTube Videos
Getting views on a YouTube video is challenging, but it’s definitely not impossible. Once you master a two-part process, it’s easy to hook viewers:
The real challengeis getting people to watchmorecontent. For example, what do you think most viewers do at the end of a video? Do they watch more content from the same channel, or do they leave to see what else YouTube has to offer?
As a growing creator, you want people to watch as many videos as possible. You want to satisfy them, make them binge your content, and show the YouTube algorithm your channel is worth promoting.

There’s a way to make it happen, but only if you know a simple YouTube trick.
First, Understand Your ‘Average Views Per Viewer’
Before we share our little trick, there’s something you should know: YouTube tells you whether your content is binge-worthy or not.
You can find this data in the YouTube Studio. It tells you if people watch multiple videos in a row or leave without watching more.
That leads us to an important metric calledaverage views per viewer, or AVPV for short. AVPV represents the number of videos each unique viewer watches on your channel (on average).
For example, let’s say your channel’s AVPV is three. That means the average viewer watches three videos on your channel before leaving.
But why is AVPV so critical on YouTube? Well, the higher this number goes, the better you are at convincing people to watch multiple videos. In fact, if your AVPV is somewhere around the number 1,that means people leave your channel after watching one video.
The survey below shows that many creators have an AVPV of 1 to 1.4. So it’s in everyone's interest to boost that figure.
How to Find Your ‘Average Views Per Viewer’ on YouTube
Now that you understand AVPV, here’s how to find yours on YouTube:
1. Go to the YouTube Studio and clickAnalyticson the left navigation bar.
2. Adjust the time period for the last full month you have data on. This switches your data points to the last 12 months of channel performance.
3. ClickSee More.
4. Click the blue plus button to add another metric. ChooseAverage Views Per Viewerfrom the menu.
5. Click theDatecolumn to sort your performance over the last 12 months.
This is what you’ll see in the end — your AVPV from 12 months ago up until today (all 12 monthsnotshown below).
How to Increase ‘Average Views Per Viewer’ — and Make People Watch More Videos
Now it’s time to reveal our little trick. If you want viewers to watch multiple videos, don’t wait for YouTube’s algorithm to show them content. Skip the waiting period and tell viewers what to watch.
How do you do this, exactly? We recommend usingYouTube end screens.
An end screen is an interactive outro that appears in the last 5-20 seconds of a video. You can put clickable elements on an end screen, such as links to a website, a YouTube subscribe button, and best of all,extra videos to watch on your channel.
But the trick isn’t to make any old end screen.
You want to make an end screen that suggests one more video to watch, not three or four. That way, viewers won’t feel overwhelmed by a bunch of options on the screen, and they can simply tap the next video.
Also, try to suggest a video that’s related to the current one. It should be an extension of the main story because that’s what people came to see.
If you do this over time — use an end screen to suggest one relevant video — your AVPVwillrise.
We tested this strategy on the vidIQ channel and found tremendous success. Instead of viewers watching one video on our channel, they now watchtwo videosbefore leaving.
Here's our AVPV in 2021 before using end screens:
And here's our AVPV in 2022 after using end screens:
More than anything, the key to success is making bold YouTube end screens. So here’s a quick guide to show you how!

Title: How Ryan Trahan Got a Billion YouTube Views Turning Pennies into Dollars

How Ryan Trahan Got a Billion YouTube Views Turning Pennies into Dollars
A few days ago, Ryan Trahan finished his trek across the U.S. to deliverone pennytoMrBeast, a popular YouTube creator. But he didn’t do it how most would. Instead of cranking up a car or boarding a plane,Ryan started a YouTube challenge.
With $0.01 to spend, he set a goal to travel from California to North Carolina, where MrBeast lives. It took some faith — and a “go with the flow” attitude — but he crushed the challenge in just 30 days.
Even more impressive, Ryan’s videos got253 million viewsthroughout June when the challenge took place. He also gained 2.3 million subscribers and helped raise $1.4 million to end hunger through a fundraiser withFeeding America.

Today, Ryan has 10.1 million subscribers andover 1 billion viewson YouTube. Most of that popularity comes from his ability to turn pennies into dollars.
Ryan Trahan’s Penny: A Catalyst for YouTube Success
If traveling on a budget of $0.01 sounds impossible, that’s because itis. Luckily for Ryan, his original penny didn’t stay a penny forever.
His main goal was to flip the penny into a few dollars, then flip those dollars intomoredollars.
So cleverly, he did three things:
By the end of day one, Ryan had $42.70. Check out the video below to see how it all unfolded.
Ryan stuck to this plan for most of  the challenge. To reach MrBeast, he was walking dogs, delivering food, and doing other odd jobs to pay for transportation, lodging, and meals. His willingness to think creatively (and fast) caught viewers’ attention.
Why Ryan Trahan’s Videos Are so Popular
Ryan brings a lot of ingenuity to his content. He's making money in unique ways, living on a lean budget, and doing it all with a smile. But other than that, what makes people watch his videos?
1. They’re motivational (and relatable).
How often have you stared at a dollar and wished it were 10? Or thought,How can I make some extra money this week?
Well, Ryan made that happen across 30 YouTube videos. If he can take the lowest denomination of money and multiply it with creativity and grit, why can’t we all? It’s easy to leave his videos feeling inspired or at least motivated to do something great.
2. They’re easy to understand.
Most people know what a penny is and what it represents. So when you see that tiny, brown coin on Ryan’s thumbnails, you don’t have to think too hard about the video’s concept.
But to be clear, Ryan doesn’t rely on using the word “penny” in his titles.The dollar sign is a globally-recognized symbol, so he writes “$0.01” instead. Viewers may not connect with the word “penny,” but they’ll immediately understand the number.
3. MrBeast is involved.
Traveling the country with one penny is an awesome idea. But you've hit a new level when you’re doing all that, plusdeliveringthe penny to a popular YouTuber.
This ideas works because MrBeast has millions of subscribers on YouTube. When Ryan mentions his name, he appeals to his own core audience plus viewers who love watching MrBeast.
4. He targets four YouTube niches at once: challenges, budgeting, making money, and travel.
It’s easy to look at Ryan’s channel and say he’s in the “challenge” niche — nothing more, nothing less. But after watching a few videos, you realize his content shows so much more:
With this approach, Ryan can attractmultiple audiences.Viewers might come from the personal finance, travel, or challenge corners of YouTube. So even if you don’t know who Ryan is or why he’s seeking a guy named MrBeast, there's something to love about the content he makes.
For a deeper analysis, check out our video breaking down the secrets to Ryan’s success:
A Well-Tested Idea
This isn’t the first time Ryan flipped a penny into a nice chunk of cash. He’s done it several times on his channel, and those videos have numerous views. This one in particular, where Ryan turns a penny into $1,000, is sitting at 16 million:
Before he was turning pennies into dollars, Ryan’s videos were a bit different. He documented his journey as a track and field athlete and posted workout content that had nothing to do with money. Over time, his views shot up when he started turning pennies into dollars.
This proves a timeless piece of advice we always share on YouTube:Experiment with new content. After all, you never know which videos will do well (or not) until you post them on your channel.
Taking the time to figure that out (like Ryan did) helps you find your “thing” on YouTube and grow your channel much faster.
Want more success stories? Here’s how a mysterious “counting channel” got 100,000 subscribers in three months.

Title: YouTube's New Keyword Research Tool: Will It Boost Your Views?

YouTube's New Keyword Research Tool: Will It Boost Your Views?
Did you hear the news? YouTube released afree keyword research toolto help you make better videos. It's located in the YouTube Studio – as most tools are – and tries to improve your content in three ways:
But does this tool reveal thebestkeywords for your channel? After all, keyword research should help you target the right audience andget more views.
We're skeptical of whether it achievesthatgoal, but the tooldoesshow words and phrases your viewers are searching for. And that's worth knowing.

How to Find YouTube's Keyword Research Tool
1. Go to the YouTube Studio (studio.youtube.com) and clickAnalyticsin the left navigation bar.
2. Click theResearchtab.
Here, you can "research some of the top searches from viewers on your channel and across YouTube in the last 28 days."
How to Use YouTube's Keyword Research Tool
The tool itself is divided into three tabs:
Tab One: Searches Across YouTube
Want to see the search volume for any YouTube keyword? Here's how to do that:
1.Click the Searches Across YouTube tab, then type any word or phrase into the search bar. We'll use "dogs" as an example.
Here, you'll see variations of the original word or phrase you typed in. For example, our query for "dogs" returned phrases like "who let the dogs out" and "cute dogs." Each term is labeled as having low, medium, or high search volume.
2.Use the filter optionsto refine your search.
You can display all keywords at once or just your "content gaps" – video topics  that currently havenoresults,fewresults, orlow-qualityresults on YouTube. A geography setting also shows keywords people use in specific locations.
3.Finally, click the three dots on the far rightto save a keyword, remove it, report it, or analyze it on Google Trends.
Tab Two: Your Viewers' Searches
On this tab, YouTube shows the topics your audience is searching for. The terms should look familiar, as they're all related to your YouTube niche – which is extremely helpful.
1. Click theYour Viewers' Searchestab.
2.Browse the keyword listto see your viewers' searches on YouTube, plus search volume.
This tab is similar to the "Searches Across YouTube" one. You can access the same options as before: filtering for content gaps, browsing keywords from specific locations, saving or removing terms, etc.
Check the previous section (Searches Across YouTube) for all filtering/saving instructions.
Tab Three: Saved Keywords
The last tab shows the keywords you saved from previous searches. Here's how to use it:
1. Click theSavedtab.
2.To remove a keyword from the list,click the three dots on the far right or click the bookmark icon.
Does YouTube's Research Tool Help You Get Views?
Now that you know how to use the tool,does it work? Will the recommended keywords producemore viewsfor your channel?
That's what the "content gaps" featureshoulddo, but it has a long way to go in terms of providingfresh, relevant video ideas.
Here's an example of what we mean: While using the tool, YouTube tells us that the phrase "how to change YouTube channel name" is a content gap for vidIQ.
But is it?
We made a video on that topic two years ago, and it has more than 600,000 views. Since then, we've posted two updated videos, and each one got significantly fewer views – 138,000, then 34,000.
The research tool wants us to make afourthvideo, but is it worth our time if we're getting fewer views already? Probably not.
And it's not just us. We made a video reviewing the new research tool, andChisgule Gamingleft a comment, saying:
To be fair, this may happen for a couple of reasons:
Despite that, we expected the tool to give usfresh video ideas(and keywords) we hadn't tried already.
But if you want to know the search volume for different keywords and which ones your viewers use, the research tool from YouTube does just that – in a basic way.
Watch this video to see a full review of the tool.
A Better Option for YouTube Keyword Research
Overall, the research tool from YouTube shows related keywords, search volume, and content gaps.
But if you need a more detailed view, tryvidIQ's keyword inspector. It shows:
Check out the example below. We typed "copyright claim" into vidIQ's keyword explorer, and thekeyword scoreis 50/100.
That's a medium score, as 100 is considered "perfect" for lowest competition and highest search volume. Also, "copyright claim" is searched 36,000 times per month. We'd pull in some decent traffic from that keyword.
In the next panel, we get a list ofrelated keywordsto expand our search.
Suggestions like "remove copyright claim" or "how to remove copyright claims on YouTube" give us more options for brainstorming video titles.
Next, we see a list ofquestions viewers askabout copyright claims.
These questions are great for building video ideas that solve specific problems. The tool shows us questions like "how to use NCS music without copyright claim" and "how to give a copyright claim."
Finally, we seetop videos for the keywordwe're exploring.
OK – that's a lot of information. But truthfully, you need as many details as possible to find suitable keywords for your content.
Want to use all of the features above? Here's how:
And if you really want to grow your views, here's a guide for finding the best YouTube keywords for your channel.

Title: 22 Simple Ways to Get More YouTube Views in 2023 (for Free)

22 Simple Ways to Get More YouTube Views in 2023 (for Free)
Understanding how to get YouTube views is a skill every creator should have in their toolbox. Because let's face it: No one wants to spend hours crafting a video, only to receive zero views after hitting publish.
So if you've ever found yourself wondering,Why don't my YouTube videos get any views, this guide is for you.
From creating better thumbnails to writing click-worthy titles, here are 22 ways to get more views on YouTube videos.

1. Focus on One YouTube Niche
It’s tempting to post whatever you want on YouTube, from DIY projects to hair tutorials to your latest cryptocurrency buy. After all, it’syourchannel, and what’s wrong with mixing things up from time to time? Viewers will learn to appreciate your love for baseball, boba tea, and trail running, right?
Unfortunately, that’s not how viewers think; they want to see videos that cater to their interests over and over again. To make that happen, you’ll want to find a niche you’re passionate about and start creating videos within that sphere.

You’ll get more views on YouTube by making focused content in the long run.
Here’s why:
2. Do Some Keyword Research Before Filming
Making popular videos is tough if you don't know what people are searching for on YouTube. The best way to overcome this hurdle is with quality keyword research.
This task puts you into the minds of viewers so you know what they intend to watch and which target keywords to use. Then, YouTube's search engine will recognize those terms and share your video with people searching for those topics.

If you need help boosting your channel's search traffic, check out thekeyword research toolfrom vidIQ. Simply type any word or phrase into the tool’s search bar to see how any keyword is performing on YouTube.
By doing this, you’ll get:
Once you find the right keywords, add them to your video title, description, and video chapters to increase your YouTube view count.
3. Write Powerful YouTube Video Titles
We haven’t gotten around to filming yet, but that’s OK. Having a list of strong keywords and understanding your niche helps you do other things to increase your views on YouTube, like optimizing video titles.
Of course,a good title has more than popular keywords.It also lets people know:
Read More:9 Ways to Write Exciting YouTube Titles for Your Videos
Here’s an example: If you filmed a video about getting YouTube subscribers, “How to Get 1,000 Subscribers,” is a good starting point for your title.
Now compare that to a title like “Under 1,000 Subscribers? Try This.” Adding that last bit of information at the end – “try this” – begs the question: What exactly should I be trying? The next logical step is to click and find out.
A boring title is usually too vague.If you write something like “Real Estate Tips for Buyers,” that’s not helpful because the real estate market is location-based. Plus, are we talking about houses, land, or commercial buildings? In this case, your title isn't specific enough.
How to Speak Your Audience’s Language
To write better titles, capture your community’s shared language with each upload.
You'll find the best example of this on a channel calledZeusy the Pitty. This adorable “talking” dog has more than 29 million views, mostly because his droopy eyes and classic head tilts are irresistible.
It also helps that Zeusy's videos have amazing titles. His owner uses keywords like “talking pit bull” because pit bulls are vocal, and it’s a relatable detail. Zeusy’s owner also calls himself “dad” to emphasize the parent-child relationship between owners and their pets.
Check out this title to see how it all comes together:“Talking Pit Bull Argues With His Dad! This Dog Is Too Smart!”
Do you see the appeal? The titlespeaks the language of dog enthusiastsand has some emotional intrigue ("this dog is too smart"). And guess what? The video has more than 170,000 views and counting.
4. Use Trending Topics to Get More Views
Do you pay attention to YouTube trends? If not, now’s the time to start because hopping on a trending topic is a great way to dominate YouTube search results.
The key to making trend-worthy videos is knowing which topics to embrace. That often meansstaying within your nicheso your channel remains focused. Every video you post needs to matter to your audience whether it goes viral or not.
Also, don’t fall into the trap ofonlyposting trending topics. You still need evergreen content to generate long-term value and get steady views. We recommend dedicating 10-20% of your content to following trends.

5. Create Attractive YouTube Thumbnails
Did you know you can upload custom thumbnails for any video after verifying your YouTube channel?
It's true. You don’t need thousands of subscribers, watch time, or a certain number of videos to do this. In fact, your channel doesn’t even have to be monetized. From day one, you can verify the phone number associated with your account and promptly upload custom graphics.
For example, check out this thumbnail from our YouTube channel. The video it’s paired with, “How to Get 4,000 Hours of Watch Time,” has more than 450,000 views. We’d say this thumbnail is working for us so far – much better than the random frame YouTube shows if you don't upload a graphic.
Here are nine tips for creating better YouTube thumbnails:

Once you’ve found the problem,download vidIQand use thethumbnail preview toolto compareyourimages to those from other creatorsbeforepublishing. Simply type in a keyword to compare different thumbnails.
6. Hook Viewers with a Good Intro
Your video’s intro is crucial. Within the first 30 seconds, viewers decide if they're going to A) keep watching or B) abandon the video.
Making them stay means you collect more watch time, which is always lovely. But a better reward is satisfying people so theyreturn to give you more views.
Want to create better intros? Here’s what you need to do:
7. Add YouTube Cards and End Screens to Your Videos
Some people pay for views on YouTube, but you should never do that – not while YouTube cards and end screens exist. They're the best tools for promoting your channel, and they're also free to use.
Info cardsare in-video notifications that recommend related content to viewers. That could be a video, playlist, extra channels you’ve created, and even outside links. When you’re aiming for more views, info cards containing videos and playlists are most helpful.
End screensappear in the last 5-20 seconds of a video. During this video outro, viewers can click an additional video of yours to watch next.
Obviously, you want people to watch 100% of a video, and info cards will interrupt that. That’s why you should add them well into the video – past the halfway mark, if possible.
8. Create Playlists for Extra YouTube Views
Once you have a large batch of content, start dividing those videos into playlists.
These collections help people explore one topic in depth. For example, a pets channel might have a playlist called "How to Teach the Sit Command to Dogs."
We recommend creating a“new to this channel”playlist before any other. Fill it with videos illustrating what your channel is about, then move the playlist to position one on your channel homepage. With any luck, new viewers will see it and understand the value of your content.
9. Optimize Your Video Descriptions
Descriptions aren't as noticeable as the thumbnails and video titles on your channel. Nonetheless, you need quality descriptions to optimize a YouTube video for more views.
To start, make your descriptions short and sweet. While the description box accepts 5,000 characters, viewers only see the first 157. They have to click “show more” to read what's left.
That’s why vital details, such as the video's topic and why it matters, should appear in the first 157 characters. You can put extra information, such as video chapters, subscribe links, and social handles, below this point.

Here are other things to keep in mind:
10. Analyze Your YouTube Metrics
Despite what many people think, going viral isn't the fastest way to get consistent YouTube views. In fact, that’s a rare phenomenon for most people.
A better approach is looking at your channel analytics, measuring video performance, and doubling down on what works most of the time.
Everything you need is in the YouTube Studio. If you go there often, you’re already familiar with this analytics screen:
But beyond this screen, you should challenge yourself to track extra YouTube metrics, such as:
11. Create These 4 Videos to Boost YouTube Views
Are you a small YouTube creator? Do you need more views right this second?
Perfect. Here are fourtypes of YouTube videospeople love watching. They'll be popular today, tomorrow, and basically forever, so capitalize on them whenever you they can.
Viewers love seeing these four formats within creators' content. With the ideas above, you can easily start earning at least 1,000 views on YouTube.
12. Reach More Viewers by Captioning Your Videos
We have to be honest about YouTube captions and auto-generated text. Most of the time, they're filled with embarrassing errors that make a video hard to understand. Sometimes a speaker will say something on camera, and YouTube will show a totally different message. That’s a problem when an estimated 38.2 million Americans over age 12 reportsome degree of hearing loss.
If you want to attract viewers from all walks of life, create transcripts of your videos. You can outsource the work using transcription services like Rev or Temi. Once you have a caption file, go to the YouTube Studio and attach it to your video before publishing.
Closed captions are great for accessibility, but people without disabilities appreciate them too. These days,69% of people watch videos without sound in public.
13. Make Sure Video Embedding Is Enabled
Letting people embed your videos across the web is a great way to boost YouTube views. It’s usually a default option, but it never hurts to double-check and ensure the feature is on.
14. Promote Your Channel on YouTube's Community Tab
YouTube does an excellent job of recommending videos to viewers, but sometimes your channel needs an extra push.
That’s where the YouTube Community tab comes in handy. This social network is available to anyone with 500 or more subscribers.
Read More:YouTube Community Tab - The Underrated Growth Tool You NEED to Use
On the Community tab, you can publish:
The Community tab isn’t for promotion, per se – or at least that’s not how most creators use it. Rather than strictly promoting videos, most people start a conversation with polls and intriguing questions. Months ago, we did an experiment proving that suchCommunity postslead to more exposure for your channel.
Once you’ve mastered the Community tab, branch out to other areas of social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, to attract more people to your channel.
15. Collaborate with Other Creators to Reach New Audiences
YouTube collaborations are a goldmine for keeping your channel fresh. When you’re brainstorming ideas alone, it’s easy to hit a wall and feel like there’s nothing worth recording.
But two heads are better than one, as the saying goes. Brainstorming with another creator removes the pressure to haveallthe answers.
The real magic happens when you and that creator make a joint video because you essentially get to swap audiences. The other creator introduces their subscribers to you, and you introduce your subscribers to that creator. Before you know it, you’ll have a new group of viewers on your channel.

Don’t team up with justanyone, though. Make sure your collaborator has:
Want to find collaborators organically?Join a digital community that represents your niche. That means exploring subreddits, Discord chats, and various Facebook groups. The goal is to find creators you like and admire and build genuine relationships with them.
16. Experiment with YouTube Shorts to Increase Views
YouTube Shorts are vertical videos with a duration of less than one minute. And guess what?They can get you more views. Shorts are similar to the type of content you’d see on TikTok – brief videos that replay on a loop and rack up millions of views.
Here’s an example of a YouTube Short:

When YouTube introduced Shorts in 2020, creators got more views just by posting them. In fact, the Shorts player in the YouTube app was getting more than6.5 billion daily viewsin March 2021.
The short-form video space is more competitive today.YouTube rolled out Shorts beta globally, so most creators have the feature.
Even still, Shorts is one of the best tools for video discovery. That’s why some creators aremaking more Shorts than long-form videos.Take a look atJake Fellman,LegalEagle,Dental Digest, andBlock Facts.
17. Engage with Your Audience Every Week
YouTube viewers are fickle when it comes to sticking around, but don’t blame them for being a tad distracted. There’s so much to see on YouTube! A viewer could visit 20 channels in five hours and leave without subscribingto any of them.
That’s why creatorsmustbuild a relationship with viewers.
Here are a few tips:
18. Make Unique, Hard-to-Replicate Content
What makes you different from other creators? If you have a superpower of any kind, such as juggling, animating, or dog whispering (yes, it’s a thing), use it to give your content some pizzaz.
Why? The harder it is to replicate your videos, the more you’ll stand out as a creator. Once you’ve found your lane on YouTube, it's easier to become the go-to person for one topic and attract more views.
Ask yourself five questions to embrace your uniqueness:
19. Go for Quantity Over Quality
Here’s the deal with being new on YouTube: No one – and we mean nobody at all – knows who you are. It's all too common to getzero viewsbecause YouTube’s algorithm hasn’t “noticed” your channel yet.
You can fix this bycreating 25-50 videos in your first six months.If each video addresses your niche, YouTube will begin to understand your content. It will know whether you’re the go-to creator for cat videos, bitcoin investing, or another topic. Eventually, YouTube will recommend your content to those enthusiasts.
Read More:Quantity Over Quality - The One Thing New YouTubers Should Focus On
Creating lots of videos is about more than appealing to the algorithm. You’ll also improve several YouTube skills:
Best of all, you’ll eventually learn to makequalityvideos as you prioritize quantity.
20. Adopt the Creator’s Mindset

...reaching those goals requires the same thing:a creator's mentality.

22. Follow YouTube’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service
There are rules to starting and growing a YouTube channel. If you don’t follow them, your dream of getting 1 billion views on YouTube (or more) will never come true.
According to the platform, channels that violate specific rules could beterminated forever. So in a way, keeping your channel in good standing is a requirement for building a relationship with viewers.
Start by readingYouTube’s community guidelines. You’ll discover rules around fake engagement, posting violent or dangerous content, and the consequences of showing illegal or regulated goods in your videos.
And one more thing: Don’t do sub4sub. It’s a spammy practice that never works, and it violatesYouTube’s terms of service.

Title: A YouTube Viewer Describes Which Videos They Click, Ignore, or Flee

A YouTube Viewer Describes Which Videos They Click, Ignore, or Flee
Have you ever wondered what goes through a viewer’s mind as they watch YouTube?Channel analyticswill give you a partial answer when you look at click-through rates, audience retention, and subscribers gained per video. This information is good to know, but it’s not the only path to understanding viewers.
On YouTube, the full picture comes fromviewerfeedback. Asking questions like, “Why didn’t you watch my last video?” or “Why did you click away in the first 30 seconds?” provides an answer data won’t reveal.
In this episode ofTubeTalk, we get that prized information fromAlbert Aydin, a YouTube fanatic who spends three hours a day on the app. As a public relations guy, he’s not on a quest togrow a YouTube channeland launch a video career. Instead, he uses his professional eye to critique content while enjoying tech, gaming, and anime videos.


To help creators understand viewers, Aydin and vidIQ executive producer Vyyyper play a game ofClick, Ignore, or Flee. We totally made that up, but the game reveals why Aydin (and possibly other viewers) ignore some YouTube videos to watch others.
What makes you click on a YouTube thumbnail?
I look at a thumbnail, and if it looks relevant to something I’m looking for, I’ll click on it. If it seems unrelated to the content, I probably won’t click as quickly.
But I also don't think too much about it. I don’t look at a thumbnail and say,Oh, I’m not going to click on this because of the thumbnail. That doesn’t deter me too much. It’s more of just, if I see three thumbnails, there might be one I click first.Is this the one that has the answer to my question?Is this the one that has the content I'm looking for?
Read More:YouTube Thumbnail Guide - 9 Ways to Boost Click-Through Rate
Which YouTube titles do you ignore?
One thing that makes me think twice before clicking on a title isif it seems too clickbaity. If it’s trying to stuff too manykeywords for YouTube search, I’m going to get a little suspicious. I’m going to be thinking,I don’t know if this is the right one.
Are you tossing every word in there to get me to click?
I would love to see moretitles that are worded for humans.
Which title would you click? 'Let’s Talk About the iPhone SE 3' or 'This iPhone Will Change the Way We Look at iPhones Forever.'
The first one. It might be because of my background in PR, comms, and messaging, and just seeing all the headlines. I’m not a fan of clickbait like that.The second title doesn’t really tell me anything.
That title can be applied to every year in the tech industry. Every year someone says product X is going to change the game – every iteration, whether it’s a Galaxy phone or it’s an iPhone.
If you tell me,Let’s talk about the iPhone SE 3, sure. I haven’t heard about that iPhone yet, or I don’t know much about it.So yeah, let’s talk about it. Teach me something.
How long do you watch a video before deciding if it’s worth your time?
Without thinking too hard into it,I would probably watch for a minute and 30 seconds. Before clicking out, I’ll fast-forward to see the rest of the video if the intro is taking too long.
When creators addvideo chapters and timestamps, I 100% use them because it's easy to jump to a section and say,Let me try this part and see if it’s what I’m looking for.
Read More:YouTube Audience Retention - 3 Channel Boosting Secrets You Need to Know
What do you expect to see in the first 30-60 seconds of a video?
I like to see the creator get to the meat of the topic. Fancy intros are great. They’re cool. But after a while, if the opener is from someone I know,I’m going to skip the introbecause I’ve seen it already.
Where do you think creators should place ads in their videos?
At the beginning of a video. If you put an ad in the middle, there’s a 50% chance I’m going to click out.
How can creators make the viewing experience better on YouTube?
The video description helps. I go there to see if the video topic is what I’m expecting. I might not read the whole description because some of them can get pretty long, but I check to see if it reaffirms the content itself.
Also, if you’re making a video with a long, drawn-out intro that has additional background and historical information – but the main goal is reviewing a product – make those extra details a separate video. I’m here for the review.Don’t make me searchfor where the review begins, or if you’re going to do that, add video chapters so I can skip ahead.
Did you learn something valuable from this interview?
Here are more tips to make the exact videos people are looking for.

Title: What the YouTube Algorithm Likes to See on Creators' Videos

What the YouTube Algorithm Likes to See on Creators' Videos
JUMP TO SECTION:
Many creators want to knowhow the YouTube algorithm works, and we can see why. For one, it’s a free, hands-off way of advertising your content to the right people. You know the algorithm will promote your best videos no matter what's happening on your channel.
But, seriously: What are YouTube recommendations based on? How do you get your YouTube videos seen by thousands of people on the platform?

First, you should know there aretwo video suggestion modelson YouTube:
In this episode ofTubeTalk, Matt Gielen, CEO ofLittle Monster MediaandElectric Monster Media, explains why YouTube recommends some videos over others. Some people think the secret is high video resolution, subscribers, and otherYouTube growth myths. But this episode reveals the truth.

As it turns out, there are no “lucky” videos. When YouTube recommends something, that means the video performs well in six areas.

1. Positive Survey Responses
Has YouTube ever asked you to complete a survey after watching a video? Most likely, your audience saw a similar notification for your content. If they chose to participate, they answered one question for YouTube’s algorithm: “What did you think of this video?” Below that prompt was a section to rate the video and describe it with words like “enjoyable” or “life-changing.”
Gielen adds another point: The more “niche” your community is, the more it engages with your content universe. So while some people ignore surveys, an engaged audience could respond with higher satisfaction.
2. YouTube Likes
What do likes do on YouTube?
Most aren’t aware, but a large number of likes will influence YouTube’s recommendation system. It starts to think,People are enjoying this video, and I should share it with more viewers.Or at least, that’s what I imagine a super-smart algorithm to sound like.
No matter what, ask viewers tosmash the YouTube like button. It’s never a bad idea.
3. High Average View Duration
Average view duration (AVD) is how long most viewers watch a video, whether that’s two minutes or a whopping 25. The algorithm loves this metric, but it’s not easy to master. Few people have the attention span (or the time) to watch video content from start to finish.
Read More:How to Increase Audience Retention on Every YouTube Video
That’s why higher AVDs appeal to the algorithm. Theextra Watch Timemeans thousands of people were willing to explore a video deeply.
Not all Watch Time is equal, though. Some people watch an entire video and leave feeling dissatisfied, so context matters. Even if a video has a high AVD, it doesn’t mean it will become a popular YouTube suggestion by that standard only.
4. YouTube Video Shares
You’ve heard the common outro for most videos: “Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe to my YouTube channel!” This call to action comes after a tutorial video, product review, explainer video, reaction video, or prank of some kind.
But something is missing from that script. Few people realize thatasking viewers to hit shareis one way to get your video recommended on YouTube.
Why? Video shares are a sign you've satisfied hundreds of viewers. That metric tells the algorithm that your video is enjoyable and worth suggesting to more people.
5. High YouTube Click-Through Rate
Click-through rate (CTR) is the percentage of viewers who click on a video after seeing its thumbnail. For example, if you have a 10% CTR, that means 10% of people who saw your video decided to click on it. The official formula for CTR is number of clicks / number of impressions x 100 = CTR.
Read More:Getting a Good Click-Through Rate on YouTube - 6 Powerful Tips
The algorithm treats CTR like a performance metric. If a video has manyclicksrelative toimpressions, it might become a YouTube video suggestion.
6. Successful Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering sounds like some complicated feature of the algorithm, but it’s pretty simple. All it means is that hypothetically, some viewers have so much in common that they’ll enjoy the same videos. To prove this theory, YouTube recommends videos to like-minded viewers until the content starts to underperform.
Think of collaborative filtering like a virus.Every time someone enjoys your content, YouTube recommends it to someone who might feel the same way. The more people you satisfy, the more YouTube recommends your video.
The algorithm sends your content through this chain of “similar viewers” until the original prediction (that people will enjoy your video) is no longer valid. That's the power of machine learning.
What Matters Most to the YouTube Algorithm
As you can see,there’s no such thing as a YouTube algorithm hack.If your views skyrocket overnight, it’s not because you learned how to beat the YouTube algorithm.
Instead, you’re getting better at two things:
More than anything, a satisfied viewer is what creates a YouTube algorithm boost.

YouTube End Screens: How to Make Cool Video Outros
YouTube end screens are interactive outros that appear in the last 5-20 seconds of a video. From the viewer’s perspective, they’re a fancy goodbye signaling the end of your content, complete with animations and beautiful backgrounds.
Except YouTube end screens are much more than that.
Looks aside, end screens are a tool for getting more views. And you can use them in every single video to recommend content and grow your channel.

How to Make a YouTube End Screen
So how do you create the right end screen for YouTube? What are the best practices to make sure your outro is engaging and click-worthy?
1. First, Make Sure Your YouTube Video is Long Enough
Your video needs to be at least 25 seconds to have an end screen. That’s easy to do if you’re like most creators. Naturally, people record for a long time and post videos spanning several minutes. Unless you’remaking a YouTube Short, you will likely have enough footage.

Above all, don’t forget to leave space at the end of your video for an outro.
2. Use the Correct Dimensions for Your YouTube End Screen
The end screen dimensions for an HD video are1920px by 1080px.That’s how big the entire frame should be. If you’re shooting in 4K, bump that up to 3840px by 1260px.
Also, make sure any custom graphics in your end screen are sharp. YouTube says your images – pictures used for the subscribe button and website links – should be at least300px by 300px.
Check out the example below. Photography creatorBen Johnsonuses a crisp self-portrait for the "subscribe" feature.
3. Use a YouTube End Screen Maker
You can make a video outro in 30 minutes using a graphic design website. Some even have YouTube end screen templates,which are extremely helpful.
Here are five remarkable end screen makers:

Growing a YouTube Channel: 4 Things Creators Overlook
JUMP TO SECTION:
Are you struggling to grow your YouTube channel? There could be dozens of reasons you aren’t getting more views and subscribers. For one, you might needbetter thumbnails– the kind that make viewers stop what they’re doing and instantly click a video. It could also be a technical problem. Maybe you have a microphone that captures weak audio; after all, videos are 50% visual and 50% auditory.
Read More:5 Mistakes That Stop Your YouTube Channel From Growing
Today, we’re going to focus on just four improvements you can make. Most creators, especially new ones, overlook these powerful tips. But in this episode ofTubeTalk, our co-hosts Dan Carson and Rob Wilson share the essentials for YouTube growth.


1. Shorten Your Video’s Intro
Your subscribers aren’t the only people who watch your videos. When a new viewer finds your channel, consider their intentions for being there. Are they coming to learn about you and your channel? Or do they want to learn more about a specific topic?
Usually, it’s the latter. That’s why you need a brief yet irresistible introduction that reinforces the video’s topic. It should reel the viewer in and stop them from clicking away.
That’s a real challenge for most people.Here are two intro mistakes we always see creators make:
Instead of doing the things above, get straight to the point.
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.Some vloggers open with the generic intro of, “Hey guys, welcome back to my channel,” and their channels are growing regardless.
Experiment and find what works for you. You might get better results by introducing yourself in the middle of the video or having no intro at all (yes, that’s a thing).
2. Make Your YouTube Videos the Right Length
If your channel isn’t growing, take a look at the length of your videos. Are they too short, leaving viewers confused about what they just saw? Or are they so long that dozens of people abandon your content?
Read More:3 Ways to Find the Best YouTube Video Length
Here’s a general rule to follow:If you can explain something in less time, do it. You’ll make tightly focused videos that people find useful, which is the key to gaining more views.
It’s also helpful to think ofhowpeople will reference a video and under what circumstances. A viewer that needs to unclog their toilet isn’t seeking a 30-minute tutorial. They need an immediate answer to their question, preferably in five minutes or less.
3. Take Video Editing Seriously
Despite what anyone says on YouTube, editing your videos is a must. Even if you’re just doing cuts to meld different scenes together, that plays a significant role in the appeal of your videos. No one wants to watch 10 minutes of lulls and dead air while other creators post beautiful, seamless stories.
Here are some editing tips to help you out:
4. Avoid Using Copywritten Materials, Especially Music
Our last tip is the most important. If you want to keep growing your YouTube channel, you have to play by YouTube’s rules. That means uploading content that belongs to you or content you have permission to use. Anything else leads to copyright claims and strikes against your channel. The penalties range fromdemonetizationto having your videos taken down to YouTube terminating your channel.
Read More:What's the Difference Between a Copyright Claim and a Copyright Strike?
Most creators run into issues when they use copywritten music; they think using 30 seconds of a popular song won’t get them in trouble. But YouTube has a Content ID system that scours the platform for “matching” media. If you use someone’s content in your video, you, YouTube, and the copyright holder will know about it.
The only exception is music used forYouTube Shorts. YouTube negotiated a deal with music labels that allows creators to use songs in brief, vertical videos – no copyright claims or strikes allowed.
Other than that, readingYouTube’s Community Guidelineswill keep you out of trouble. You’ll learn helpful tips, likehow to get royalty-free music from the YouTube audio library.

Title: Getting a Good Click-Through Rate on YouTube: 6 Powerful Tips

Getting a Good Click-Through Rate on YouTube: 6 Powerful Tips
JUMP TO SECTION:
Getting a good click-through rate (CTR) on YouTube is a big deal. That helps you solve a major problem, which is getting YouTube to recommend your videos to viewers.
If you’ve been on YouTube for a while, you know the algorithm won’t suggest any old video. It servesvaluable contentwith proven success. Creators who supply such content are likely to get more views and grow their channels.

That’s why you need a good CTR. When YouTube knows you’re getting thousands of clicks, itwantsto recommend your content. It’s like creating the perfect resume for your channel.
Plus, your click-through rate helps you identify winning strategies. If your CTR rises when you use a certain thumbnail template, that’s worth knowing. If it drops when you use a new titling format, that’s also something to evaluate.
Want to learn more about getting a good click-through rate? Just keep reading.
What Is Click-Through Rate on YouTube?
According toYouTube, your click-through rate is “how often viewers watched a video after seeing [its] thumbnail.”
So if 30 people clicked on a video, but 1,000 saw the thumbnail overall, you’d have a click-through rate of 30%.
How to See Your Click-Through Rate In the YouTube Studio
Before you try to increase your CTR, figure out what your current percentage is.
Here’s how to find that number:
Here’s what the CTR graph looks like. It shows your rate over time, and you can hover over the play buttons to see which videos produced certain rates:
The graph above is from the vidIQ channel. As you can see, our CTR is 5.1% for the last 28 days.
Scrolling down further reveals a chart showing how many impressions we received in that period.
What Is a Good Click-Through Rate?
At one point, YouTube stated that “half of all channels and videos on YouTube have an impressions CTR that can range between 2% and 10%.”
Is your CTR within this range? If so, don't set wild expectations for yourself. YouTube's general range for CTR is just extra information; if you're at 2%, don't fall in love with idea of reaching 10% anytime soon. Slow and steady improvements will take you where you need to be.
Also, be careful about how you interpret YouTube's general CTR range. If you’re a small creator getting 100 impressions per video, it only takes a consistent 20 viewers for a 20% click-through rate. Compare that to a large channel with 150,000 impressions and 10,000 views. That’s a 6.6% click-through rate.
No matter what the numbers say, put your CTR into perspective:

One note about setting a CTR benchmark: how you do that is totally up to you. Our CTR on the vidIQ channel is 5.1% right now. But across the lifetime of our channel, it’s 6%. In that case, we might make 6% our true benchmark – which means we’d need to first meet and then exceed that rate.
A good click-through rate is ideal, but it’s not the only signal YouTube uses to grade your videos. Here’s a handy guide onhow YouTube recommends your content to viewers.

YouTube Success: 3 Steps to Create Valuable, Highly-Watched Videos


Every creator goes through a period of frustration on YouTube – a phase where their channel just isn’t growing. Popular videos start to underperform. Viewers aren’t subscribing. It’s confusing to the creator because they’re working hard to create vlogs, tutorials, and live streams. But for some reason, viewers aren’t interested.

Getting over this hump takes serious self-reflection. You have to separate yourself from your content and ask,“What am I doing incorrectly?”
Read More:5 Mistakes That Stop Your YouTube Channel From Growing
Ben Leavitt, a social media strategist and YouTube creator, has a hunch about why some creators fail. Before he crossed 79,000 subscribers, there was a time when his YouTube channel wasn’t growing.
Most creators don’t succeed because of one, pesky oversight. Before you can obsess over thumbnails or video equipment, you need to create a value proposition.
Here's a glossary of everything you need to know:
Value Propositions: Why Every Creator Needs One
A value proposition is a promise you make to viewers. It’s a two-part descriptor that helps people understand the value they’ll receive by viewing your content.
A good value proposition includes:
If your channel isn’t growing, it’s because you haven’t done the things above. You haven’t created content that delivers a clear benefit, whether that’s education, entertainment, or something in between.That’s the simple trick to getting more views.Until you address viewers’ needs, they’ll move on to a channel that satisfies those cravings.
How to Create a Valuable YouTube Channel
It’s easy to create a value proposition when you have a clear goal. But what if you're unsure of the value you bring? How does one offer something useful while figuring out their content?
Don't worry. In three powerful steps, you cancreate a valuable channeland watch your views skyrocket.
Step 1: Identify Your Niche
If you target every viewer, you’ll appeal to no one. Leavitt says successful creators know exactly who their videos are for.
Some people have a skill or passion that can become a niche. Many creators teach those hobbies on YouTube, whether that’s skincare, personal finance, music, or another topic.
Read More:Starting a YouTube Career - 7 Steps to Monetize Your Passion
If you can't find a niche right away, just experiment. Post videos about stuff you’re interested in and see which topics get the most likes, views, and comments. Those are the signals to pay attention to.
Step 2: Don’t Worry About Being Seen as an Expert
This is an important one. You don’t need to be an expert to make videos about certain topics. If you’re curious about something and can see yourself learning about it for years, explore that niche on YouTube.
Step 3: Get Unbiased Feedback
Good videos are created through slow and steady improvements. But enhancing your channel by yourself is no easy task. A solo creator needs another person – someone distanced from the situation – to critique their content.
Those unbiased people can also be your subscribers. Ask them to rate different factors of your content, such as how clear the information is, the structure of your videos, and the audio quality. You can collect responses in a Community Tab poll.

How to Communicate the Value of Your YouTube Channel
So far, we’ve shared two ways to fix a channel that isn’t growing. We’ve talked about making your content more valuable and having a proposition that “sells” your videos to viewers.
But how does this work in action?
Communicating your channel’s value isn’t hard, but you have to do it often – ideally at the beginning of each video. Here’s a hypothetical script that quickly gets the point across:
And just like that, you’ve introduced your channel and the immediate value of your video. It only takes 15 seconds, which is all you have on a platform as competitive as YouTube.
You can also do this visually. Put your value proposition on your channel banner so people know what to expect. OurvidIQbanner is bright and tells you exactly what we’re about: YouTube education.

Making Valuable Videos Is a Learning Process
No matter what, don’t quit YouTube because your channel isn’t growing. Oftentimes, it’s not your niche that’s unpopular; it’s the way you’re creating within that space. In each video, you have to identify and deliver the value people want.
The right content can take your channel from zero to 1,000 subscribers.Make these four videosto speed up the process.

Title: 5 Mistakes That Stop Your YouTube Channel From Growing

5 Mistakes That Stop Your YouTube Channel From Growing


No matter how long you’ve been a YouTube creator, you’re bound to make mistakes. You might upload a video while your core audience is sleeping. Or you might choose the wrong title for 50% of your content. There are dozens of ways to mess up, whether you have one subscriber or one million.

Of course, the steepest learning curve is at the beginning. New creators want to know how tomake better videos,get more views, and attract subscribers.
To do all of these things better, watch the video below. In it, we discuss five mistakes that stop your channel from growing.
As a quick summary, here are the top five mistakes:

Are you guilty of these blunders? Here’s how to overcome each one and succeed on YouTube.
1. Not Paying Attention to Video Thumbnails
The thumbnail you choose for each video matters. Alongside the title, it’s the first thing viewers see before clicking on a video. If the graphic is colorful but simple, it’s likely to be clicked. Anything that looks cluttered or takes more than a second to understand won’t make a good thumbnail.
Remember, your experience on YouTube is not the same as the viewer’s. They want to skim past thumbnails and find a video to watch – quickly. That’s why your thumbnail should have three, easy-to-understand qualities:
Read More:How to Make YouTube Custom Thumbnails
There’s a trick you can use to instantly grade your thumbnails. Derral Eves developed this strategy, and he describes it in his new book, “The YouTube Formula.” To start, open the YouTube mobile app and type your channel’s name into the search bar. Notice how the results show two to three videos at most on your screen.
Now close your eyes for five seconds. After that, open them for one second. Now close them again!
Which thumbnail stood out more? That’s the one you should study as you strive to make better graphics.
2. Only Thinking About Views and Subscribers
Every creator wants more views and subscribers. In fact, some will go to Google and type “how to get more views and subscribers” into the search bar. But that’s the wrong way to think about YouTube. Views and subscribers are a long-term reward – the result of doing lots of little things correctly.
Toget your first 1,000 subscribersor repeat viral success, you need to understand the dozens of steps that come before those milestones.
Spend some time learning about these key YouTube metrics:
If you can improve or understand these behind-the-curtain metrics, you’ll get more views and subscribers over time.
3. Never Experimenting With Your Content
Listen up, creators. Your YouTube channel is not made of glass. One mistake won’t shatter it. In fact, the biggest mistake you can make is never experimenting. The more you hold on to past success, the less you grow, adapt, and improve.
Take YouTube Shorts, for example. This content type of vertical, less-than-a-minute videos wasintroduced last year. It’s the opposite of what most creators are used to, which are lengthy, horizontal videos. But for creators willing to experiment with Shorts, the payoff has been huge.
Jake Fellmanis the breakout star. His channel features video game Shorts, which contain 3D scenes from titles like Among Us and Minecraft. Those custom animations attracted more than 4 million subscribers to his channel, plus 3.46 billion views.
Read More:How This YouTube Creator Got 1.5 Billion Views In Just 80 Days
Fellman was an early adopter of Shorts. As a result, he didn’t have much competition – which is why you should always try new things on YouTube.
4. Blaming Failures on a Lack of Equipment
You don’t need expensive technology to grow a YouTube channel. It’s better to expand your creation and promotion skills in the beginning – learning how to do keyword research, creating better videos, making awesome thumbnails, and more. So if you see a $1,000 camera or a $500 softbox in your local department store, keep walking. You can do a lot on YouTube with natural light and a smartphone.

It’s OK to upgrade your gear when you can afford to and your channel is growing. But until then, don’t blame your failures on any piece of technology. MrBeast, a creator with around 60 million subscribers, never did. In a Twitter post, he explained how he used his YouTube revenue to slowly invest in his content.

5. Creating a Video Without Researching Its Topic
Researching isn’t always fun, but it’s necessary. If you want to become the top creator in your niche, whether that’s gaming, cooking, beauty, or another topic, you need to explore those types of channels. Open the YouTube app and do some basic searches. Then ask yourself three questions to narrow your focus:
This is where vidIQ can help. When youdownloadour free browser extension, you’ll get access to YouTubecompetitor tools. You can add competitors to a watch list and keep an eye on the content they’re uploading. Or you can export a list of their top-performing keywords to improve your search rankings.

It’s easy to correct common YouTube mistakes, but some errors are hard to come back from. As you grow your channel, avoid theseeight legal pitfallson YouTube.

Title: Quantity Over Quality: The One Thing New YouTubers Should Focus On

Quantity Over Quality: The One Thing New YouTubers Should Focus On


Here’s a question with two extreme options. As a new creator, would you rather spend a month making one video or crank out 30 videos in 30 days?

Hypothetically, this is your first month on YouTube. It’s a tough question to answer because there are no in-between options. You can’t make 15 videos that month or even five. You have to choose: Thirty videos or just one.
So what’s your answer?
If you need some inspiration, here are some responses to get you thinking. According to the vidIQ community (and whoever else the YouTube algorithm sends Community polls to), most people would make one quality video.

Our poll got 20,000 responses. Seventy-three percent were in favor of one quality video and 27% opted for 30 videos.
As YouTube educators, we're going to have to side with the 27%.
Quality vs. Quantity: Which Is Better for New Creators?
When you’re just starting out on YouTube, making one video over 30 days doesn’t help you grow. And we’re not just talking about views and subscribers. One video doesn't let you track your overall growth. You’ll never know how your lighting, audio, or presentation style is improving because you’ve only attempted those things once.
Tech creatorMarques Brownleeagrees with us. In aninterviewwith Luria Petrucci of Live Streaming Pros, he had the same idea about quality versus quantity.
This practice is a “forever thing,” says Brownlee. No matter how big you get on YouTube, you should always try toimprove your content.
Eventually, Making Lots of Videos Leads to Quality Content
Before you start a channel, you need to understand seven core principles to succeed on YouTube. One of those isdeveloping a healthy relationship with perfectionism. Every creator wants to make the best video possible. But if making a perfect video outweighs your desire to test and learn, you could be missing out on valuable experience.
Read More:7 Beliefs You Need to Have to Grow a YouTube Channel
Most new creators don’t know how to make videos people enjoy. They have to try new things and learn as they go. That’s why, in your first month on YouTube, making the perfect video shouldn’t be your priority.
Instead, you should focus on:
You only learn the above skills by making lots of content. In six months, you'll look back at those early videos and probably find them unwatchable – and that's perfectly fine. It’s a necessary feeling. Take that disappointing moment, that pang of discomfort in your chest, and turn it into a list of improvements for your channel.
Don’t Focus on Your Audience Just Yet
Studying your audience is the key to growing on YouTube. But is it the best place to start when you’ve just created a channel?
In our opinion, the answer is no. If you’re a new creator, you're skipping a few steps if you plan to immediately study your audience. There aren’t many people watching your videos at this point. For now,just focus on your skill set – filming, presenting, editing, and optimizing.That’s a better investment of your time than analyzing your first 20 subscribers. We explain this even further in the video below.
As the years go by, this will likely change. You’ll get to the point where you have thousands of views and subscribers. Viewers will start leaving lots of comments on your videos, which means you’ve built a community. That’s when your priorities will make a 180-degree shift. Now that you have some technical knowledge, you can finally focus on your audience.
This is a good way to play it smart on YouTube and never, ever, waste your energy. Because honestly, the beginning of your journey is about answering one question:Do I even like making videos?
You don’t get the answer by studying your audience; you get it by making enough videos to form an opinion about YouTube as a whole.

Now, to be fair, you don’t have to make 30 videos in 30 days. A realistic number is probably five to 12 videos when you're just starting out. But we presented the question with two extremes to help you understand what’s important on YouTube.
In most careers, nothing beats experience. The same is true on YouTube, but even more so considering how much content you need to gain millions of views and subscribers. But don’t worry. As you post more videos, you cando this one thing to get more views.

YouTube Algorithm Guide: How Your Videos Are Recommended to Viewers


YouTube just exposed its own algorithm. In a video posted toCreator Insider, YouTube product manager Rachel Alves discussed how the video recommendation system works. She explained how videos get discovered, whether that’s on the YouTube homepage or suggested content areas. Then she offered tips to make click-worthy videos for those places.

This is valuable information for creators, and yet, it’s not life-changing advice to help you go viral. It’s good to understand how the system works. But if that’s your only focus, growing on YouTube will be the same challenge its always been.
Read More:How to Start a YouTube Channel – 10 Brilliant Tips
The real focus should be your audience, not an algorithm. Viewers are the heart of the system, and the machinery is there to support their intent.
Above all, that statement is what Alves wants you to grasp. In the video below, each secret about the algorithm comes with a caveat:Study your audience.
Want to learn how YouTube recommends videos? Just keep reading. You can use the secrets below plusaudience datato make better content.
How YouTube Recommends Your Videos to Viewers
The YouTube algorithm has two goals when recommending videos:
Overall, YouTube wants people to return to the platform because they enjoyed being there. But finding the best way to do that took years of testing and correcting.
In the past, clicks and views were supreme. YouTube recommended popular videos to viewers, even if they included clickbait titles and thumbnails. Around 2011, viewers shared their feedback, and it wasn’t positive. Users didn’t want sensationalized or misleading content on their homepages.
To fix this, YouTube started prioritizingWatch Timein 2012. In theory, how long someone watches a video should reveal how much they enjoyed it. But like clicks and views, Watch Time wasn’t a perfect metric. Just because someone watches a 15-minute video about dog training, that doesn’t mean they enjoyed the experience. There could be other reasons they watched until the end. Maybe their puppy destroyed three couch pillows, and the owner desperately needed to correct the behavior.
Eventually, YouTube decided thatsatisfaction indicates the value of a video.Instead of prioritizing how long someone watched, the better question to ask was, did they enjoy it? Would they do it again?
How YouTube Measures Viewer Satisfaction, the Catalyst for Video Recommendations
From 2015 to now, YouTube has prioritized viewer satisfaction. It’s also placed an emphasis on promoting responsible content, which helps viewers fulfill their search intent. If you’re looking for ways to fight hyperpigmentation, for example, it’s best to learn from an authoritative source on YouTube – perhaps an esthetician or a dermatologist.
YouTube does three things to discover and promote satisfying, responsible content:
YouTube Surveys
YouTube trains its prediction models using surveys – millions of them. Even with a large number of surveys going out, viewers aren’t inundated with feedback requests. Alves says they may receive one or two surveys each month. The surveys ask for video ratings and why the viewer enjoyed the video. They’re able to select words such as “informative,” “life-changing,” “inspiring,” and more. The goal is to gauge which videos are truly satisfying and not just highly watchable.
This data isn’t available to creators yet, but Alves says YouTube is working on it.
Likes, Dislikes, Shares, and Not Interested Signals
When someone likes your video, that tells YouTube your content is satisfying. The same logic is applied to video shares. Additionally, YouTube is paying attention to interest level, or how often viewers say they’re “not interested” in a video.

Now that you know likes and dislikes serve a purpose on YouTube, always aim to please. And be sure todownload vidIQto see the percentage of likes and dislikes on every video. These percentages are green when videos have lots of likes and red when there are more dislikes. Going forward, you can do an audit of your channel andsee which videos are producing more likes than dislikes.Videos in the dislike category may reveal what you can tweak in your content strategy.
How YouTube Ranks Videos
For most channels, Alves says the YouTube homepage and suggested content areas are top traffic sources. The homepage recommends videos based on a user’s watch history. Suggested content appears alongside a video someone is currently watching.
No matter how hard you try, there’s nothing you can do, statistically, to influence these traffic areas.
Ranking Videos on a Viewer’s Homepage
YouTube uses two categories to rank homepage videos. The first isvideo performance.Some of those metrics include:
All of this has to do with how videos perform on homepages. Before making a recommendation, YouTube wants to know if people watched those videos, selected “not interested” or performed other actions.
Personalization is the second category. YouTube pays attention to viewers’ watch history, including how often they watch videos from certain channels.

Sometimes it goes even the deeper than that. Videos that are watched one after the other, as well as topically-related content, are fair game.

4 Tips to Make Your Content Suggestion-Worthy
How to Make Videos That Satisfy Your Audience
With YouTube tracking viewer satisfaction, that means one thing for you and your content:You can’t just make informative videos and expect to get more views.They have to be enjoyable too, or YouTube won’t recommend them.
But how do you make a satisfying video?
You can start by copying what YouTube is doing. You canask your audiencehow they feel about your videos and encourage them to leave comments. Maybe you're testing a new filming background or a different teaching method on YouTube. To know if your videos are truly enjoyable, get some feedback.
There are lots of little ways to make satisfying videos too. You should always:

In the past, YouTube required channels to have more than 1,000 subscribers to access the Community tab feature. But that's about to change, as YouTube is making the social feed more accessible to creators with smaller audiences. Starting October 12, 2021, you will only need more than 500 subscribers to access the YouTube Community tab.
If you haven't reached 500 subscribers, don't worry. YouTube has a plan to help you engage with your audience as well.
Why You Should Post on the YouTube Community Tab
Once you've unlocked Community posts, you can use them to connect with viewers and increase your channel’s exposure.
Consider this, for example. What if you could reach your core audience multiple times a day without posting a video – only polls, GIFs, images, and text? What if your next poll gets 50,000 votes because YouTube’s algorithm promotes it across the app?

That’s what’s happening right now. Our vidIQ polls receive a jaw-dropping number of votes. The exposure introduces our channel to thousands of viewers we’ve never reached on YouTube.
Can the same thing happen to you? Absolutely.
Reaching a New Audience with YouTube Community Posts
Every Wednesday, we host a live stream on the vidIQ channel. One of our viewers, theChessGeek, asked an important question during the Q&A session:Should creators use the Community tab, and how does it affect channel growth?
Our answer isyes. To prove it, we voted on one of ChessGeek’s polls. Our theory was that, when someone engages with a Community post, they’ll see more posts from that channel.
Guess what happened less than 24 hours later? The morning following that live stream, a Community post from the ChessGeek was on our homepage. It nearly covered the entire screen.
Days later, we saw more Community posts from this creator, and we never watched a single video of theirs.
So we proved our theory. On YouTube, it’s possible to:
Watch our video below for more examples of how the Community tab fuels your growth:
Does the YouTube Community Tab Have Its Own Algorithm?
Beating the YouTube algorithm is something we’d never encourage you to do. It’s virtually impossible, and there are better things to focus on. Building an audience is more rewarding than chasing dozens of viral videos.
Still, we’re curious about the algorithm behind YouTube’s Community posts. Is it a separate algorithm or is it the same one that recommends videos to viewers? It feels like there’s an independent algorithm for both.
But if that’s true, it means a user is just as likely to see Community posts as they are videos. And we know which one takes longer to create.You can spend two minutes crafting a Community post. A videos takes hours.
We’re not going to say Community posts will get you more views. But we can’t deny that the exposure could lead to more views and subscribers for your channel. At this point, every creator with more than 1,000 subscribers (and soon, 500) should be postingsomethingon their Community tab.
Videos vs. Community Posts
Videos and Community posts are very different, but they both have their place on YouTube. That’s why it’s smart to post each type on your channel. If you’re making videos while never posting on the Community tab, you’ll miss a chance to connect with viewers. In fact, sometimes Community posts getmoreengagement than videos.
For example, we posted a Community poll about whether YouTube should hide dislikes on videos. A whopping 29,000 people voted. There were hundreds of comments and more than 2,000 likes.We received all this by posting one question and two emojis.
Engaging with a Community post is simple. It often takes one tap. With a video, viewers have to watch for several minutes before seeing something they can comment on – if they decide to comment at all.
To get the most engagement from your Community posts:
Connecting with your audience helps you grow your YouTube channel. Before you do that on any other platform, learn how to use the Community tab.

Title: YouTube Cheat Code Unlocked: How to Track Returning Viewers on Your Channel

YouTube Cheat Code Unlocked: How to Track Returning Viewers on Your Channel


Of all the new viewers on your YouTube channel, how many return to watch more videos? If a large number of people keep coming back, that’s a good sign. On the flip side, having thousands of unengaged subscribers means you have some work to do.

This year, YouTube is helping creators bridge the gap. The platform has released a new feature that tracks both new and returning viewers to a channel. With these metrics, you can gauge long-term growth instead of temporary wins, such as going viral.
Here’s what it looks like in the YouTube Studio:
There are two new lines (metrics) on this graph. The blue one represents new viewers and the purple one shows how many viewers returned to your channel. When the purple line grows upward, so does your overall audience.
If the YouTube algorithm were something to beat, this would be a major cheat code. Keep reading to learn why returning visitors are worth more than subscribers and how you can leverage this new data.
How to See the Number of Returning Viewers to Your YouTube Channel
Next, you’ll see an audience graph tracking unique visitors and subscribers. But by default, you should land on a new section that shows new and returning viewers.
Need help finding this graph? Watch our video tutorial below:
How to Analyze Returning Viewer Data on YouTube
Getting more subscribers is great, but attracting viewers who keep returning is impactful. When you gain a subscriber, that means someone liked your content enough to digitally “bookmark” it. The best scenario is when that subscriber returns to watch more videos.
We can see the difference between both behaviors on thevidIQchannel. Here is our audience data for new and returning viewers within the past three months:
In the beginning, we attracted 15,519 returning viewers daily. By the end of this time period, our returning viewer count increased to 24,217.
As more viewers returned to watch our content, other metrics improved. Daily channel views increased from 58,604 to 89,593 views. And now YouTube’s algorithm is finding more viewers to watch our content. We can tell by looking at our daily impressions, which nearly doubled in that same period.
Our new and returning viewer data hasn’t always been positive, though. We posted a few videos aboutMrBeast– a creator who gets millions of views with each upload – and actually lost returning viewers. He’s a popular creator, so we did gain some new viewers. But overall, we attracted an audience outside our niche. Our core audience subscribed to learn YouTube growth tips.
Take a look at the graph below. It shows a spike in new viewers and a decrease in returning viewers to the vidIQ channel:
This shows a lack of focused content during our MrBeast experiment. We strayed from YouTube education so viewers didn’t watch as many videos.
On the flip side, here’s what the data looks like when we stick to our niche:
As you can see, new and returning viewers increased in this period. Below the graph, we can see which videos were published during this time:
These videos are about YouTube channel growth. Each one sticks to our niche and creates the right conditions for a large, growing audience.
3 Examples of YouTube Viewer Graphs and What They Mean
As soon as we discovered YouTube’s new and returning viewer data, we asked the vidIQ community to share their analytics with us. This data comes from creators like you, so it’ll be helpful to learn from their successes and mistakes.
Here are three graph examples to diagnose why viewers are returning to or abandoning your channel.
Graph 1: A Dip In Consistency
From the data, it looks like this creator knew their audience well. Each video attracted returning viewers in the beginning. Unfortunately, a lack of consistency killed their momentum, which is proven by the disappearance of black play buttons underneath the graph. Those represent published videos. Return viewer growth began to flatten in January, but the solution is simple: Start creating again.
Graph 2: Popular Videos But Few Subscribers
This graph is a tale of two extremes. YouTube brought lots of new viewers to this channel every day, which is awesome. However, almost none of them come back.
Why does this happen? Most likely, one or a few videos drove traffic to the channel and caused their content torank higher in YouTube search. But after watching those videos, perhaps viewers didn’t think the channel had anything else to offer them – hence, fewer people subscribing.
Graph 3: “Beating” the YouTube Algorithm
This channel seems to have endless growth. In this case, YouTube is finding new viewers that return to watch more content, which helps the channel grow.
This analytics graph belongs toJake Fellman, who creates custom, 3D-animated Among Us content. He has 3.5 billion subscribers and more than 2 billion views.
Jake’s channel has more returning viewers than new viewers, which means he’s basically beaten the algorithm – or reached peak content optimization. If you can get the purple line (returning viewers) above the blue line (new viewers), you’ve converted many new viewers into returning viewers.
4 Ways to Make Viewers Return to Your YouTube Channel
Attracting more return viewers leads to YouTube growth. Fortunately, convincing them to come back doesn’t require a complicated, exhausting strategy. You can follow the same core principles ofgrowing a YouTube channel.
All you need to do is...
There’s no beating the YouTube algorithm. All you can do is work with it to help your content reach more people. The first step is viewing, studying, and acting on insights from your channel analytics.

How to Get More Views on YouTube in 24 Hours

How do your YouTube videos perform in the first 24 hours of publishing? Is there a surge of positive momentum or do most of your views trickle in days later?
For some creators, views earned in this one-day period can push their content to new heights. They’ll get lots of views from YouTube notifications, and in turn, the algorithm suggests their content to more viewers.

Apart from going viral, that’s the kind of mojo you want to have on YouTube. You should strive to make your videos appear in valuable areas of the app, such as browse features, YouTube search, and suggested videos.
To make it happen, start comparing your videos’ performance over the first 24 hours. It’s as simple as:
Step four has gotten much easier this year. Instead of opening two browser windows, you can view a side-by-side comparison for each video using YouTube’s latest tool for 24-hour views.
How to See Video Views on YouTube in the First 24 Hours
To compare video views in the YouTube Studio, follow these steps:
Need a visual tutorial? Watch the video below to make sure you’re doing everything correctly:
How to Analyze 24-Hour View Data on YouTube
As an example, let’s say we want to analyze the 24-hour views for our recent video, “How to Start a YouTube Gaming Channel In 2021.” After completing the steps above, the below results are what we see in the YouTube Studio.
Scrolling down a bit farther, we also see a list of traffic sources for video views in the first 24 hours.
With this data, we can ask ourselves a few questions about the video’s performance, and hopefully, create better content.
Question 1: Compared with other content, did the video overperform or underperform?
We can check this by looking at the traffic sources data. Via the screenshot above, it looks like our video overperformed in YouTube search views and underperformed in YouTube recommendation views. We know this because we hovered our mouse over each traffic source, which triggered a pop-up showing our typical video performance.
Here's what the vidIQ channel usually averages for these two sources:
That means our 2.8K views from YouTube recommendations is a tad low for this video.
On the flip side, getting 957 search views is excellent. That means we did a good jobtargeting specific keywordsfor the video, and the effort paid off.
Question 2: Did changing the video’s thumbnail or title in the first 24 hours affect its views?
To answer this question, we need to check the number of impressions the video earned, as well as its click-through rate. So instead of viewing the Overview tab, clickReachnear the top of the page. You should instantly see a graph showing video impressions, like the one below.
Next, you can clickImpressions Click-Through Rateto view another graph showing the video's click-through rate in the first 24 hours.
When you update your video’s thumbnail or title in the first 24 hours, try to remember which hour you made the change. For example, you may decide to update a video’s title and thumbnail 12 hours after publishing.
With that in mind, you can check these two graphs to see if there are significant spikes or dips after the 12th hour. That alone should prove which title/thumbnail produces a better click-through rate or number of impressions.
Get Views Data Faster With vidIQ’s Real-Time Stats Bar
Right now, we're showing you the long method for checking YouTube views. It's thorough but not always practical, which is why you should have a backup plan when you're busy filming, uploading, or promoting your videos.
When youdownload vidIQ, you can quickly check your YouTube views with the real-time stats bar. This handy tool sits at the top of all YouTube pages and displays crucial information, such as:
All of this is free, by the way. If you want to know how many views your channel is getting at all times, simplydownload vidIQto get started.
How to Compare the 24-Hour Views of Two YouTube Videos
OK, here’s the question most creators want us to answer: How does one determine which videos are performing well in the first 24 hours?
Fortunately, the answer is just a few clicks away. Here's how to grab that data in the YouTube Studio:
This will allow you to select a second video from your channel and compare its first 24 hours to the initial video you were analyzing. To test this, we compared two videos with similar YouTube performance, as shown below.
If you clickTraffic Sourcein the uppermost tab, you can see the traffic breakdown for each video.
As you can see, “How to Start a Gaming Channel in 2021” got more search traffic in the first 24 hours.That video may become evergreen content on YouTube, appearing in search results for years to come.
“How to Get Your First 100 Subscribers on YouTube” performed better in every other metric, such as browse features, suggested videos, and YouTube notifications.That’s indicative of a powerful title and thumbnail.Altogether, we can glean useful information from both videos and combine strategies to create better content.
What would really be helpful though, is the ability to compare one video with dozens more. That way we could track the effectiveness of a series of videos covering one topic.
If YouTube makes this tiny change, the First 24 Hours tool would be almost perfect.
In the meantime, vidIQ has a channel audit tool that displays exactly what’s working on your channel. It’s free to start using, sodownload vidIQfor channel insights that’ll earn you more YouTube success.

Title: Why It's Not Too Late to Start a YouTube Channel in 2021

Why It's Not Too Late to Start a YouTube Channel in 2021
If you haven’t started a YouTube channel yet, now's the time. The platform has more than 2B monthly users, which means you have plenty of opportunities to find and grow your ideal audience.
That doesn't mean it's an easy job, though. With YouTube being a free platform, millions of people have launched channels with dreams of starting a profitable business. Many creators have reached success, but you'll need a solid YouTube strategy to do the same.
You can start by prioritizing these seven powerful tasks on YouTube:

Mastering each skill is easier said than done, but it's possible. If you need some motivation, watch the video below to see how seven creators used the game plan above to grow their channels.
Need more proof? Here’s an in-depth analysis of how these creators quickly grew their channels in 2020.
Becoming a YouTube Authority: How ‘100 Percent Zelda’ Dominated One Topic
If you’re a fan ofZelda: Breath of the Wild,you probably know about100 Percent Zelda. This channel teaches key survival tactics in the popular video game - how to farm superfoods, tips for finding the best weapons, how to set battle traps, everything.
100 Percent Zelda has been on YouTube for nine months. But in a short amount of time, the channel has amassed more than 30K subscribers and 4M views. That’s no easy feat, especially when you consider the competitive nature of gaming.
So what’s the secret to this channel’s success? It’s simple:Focus on one thing and never deviate from that.The creator playedonegame(Breath of the Wild)and taught players how to survive its biggest challenges. Instead of posting a bunch of random videos, 100 Percent Zelda made a commitment to cater to its audience.
You can accomplish the same thing on YouTube. Simply decide on a niche, thendo what 100 Percent Zelda did. Post content many viewers find useful, and never, ever, abandon your audience.
Want to know more? We filmed a case study on this channel months ago, and you can soak up all the wisdom below:
Stimulus Talk: How ‘ClearValue Tax’ Got More YouTube Views In 2020
In the thick of COVID-19,ClearValue Taxgave viewers the information they desperately needed: how to quickly get their stimulus checks. That prized information helped the channel grow from 200 subscribers to more than 1M.
Brian Kim, the certified public accountant who appears on camera, doesn’t add any fluff to his videos. Within 10 seconds, he says exactly what he’s going to cover and dives right in. The production value is fine, but it’s not overly polished with excessive editing.
Additionally, the video thumbnails on this channel are simple freeze-frames from the footage itself, as shown below:
But guess what? None of that matters as much when you’re helping thousands of people get the free money they’re entitled to. You can overlook some of YouTube’s best practices because viewers need the information that badly.
Nonetheless, ClearValue Tax did what counts most on YouTube. The creator posted frequently, which is half the battle. The channel also used relevant keyphrases, such as ‘second stimulus check update’ and ‘get your stimulus check’.
‘Dad, how do I?’ Gets More YouTube Views With Fatherly Advice
Want to start a YouTube channel that earns 3M subscribers and 12.5M views? If so, you’ll want to follow the wisdom ofDad, how do I?This channel is successful because its value proposition is clear. In each video, the creator teaches a skill most people need to know.
Simply put, a value proposition is a promise. It’s a declaration of what viewers can expect to gain from your channel, and every creator on YouTube should have one.
Dad, how do I? has a subliminal value proposition. Without the creator saying a word, you instantly know what it means to ask your father for help. The name of the channel promises you a certain kind of video before you press play.
More importantly, the content delivers on that promise. You get videos about everyday tasks, such as how to tie a necktie.
If you have dreams of going viral, take notes from this uber-successful channel. Make a promise to your viewers, then keep your word by posting the type of content they originally subscribed to see.
‘Paths Interactive Videos’ Finds a New Way to Boost Channel Watch Time
Paths Interactive Videosisn’t like the other channels on this list. In three months, it has only earned 6K subscribers and 45K views, which is nowhere close to the millions we’ve previously discussed.
However, we believe this channel is one Reddit share away from going viral. That’s because it brings the classic joy of choose-your-own-adventure books to the YouTube world.
On the Paths channel, each video tells a story. When the video ends, viewers get to decide where the story goes next by clicking an end-screen thumbnail that whisks them to another video. It's a novel approach to YouTube, and we haven't seen this content strategy anywhere else - except maybe on Twitter threads.
This storybook content may help the Paths channel explode. It has the potential to increase channel Watch Time, which is a crucial metric for getting more views on YouTube.
Furthermore, a video with a high viewing duration has a better chance of being recommended to more people. On the Paths channel, this is almost mandatory because you have to watch the full video to complete a story.
So each video earns a ton of Watch Time, gets recommended to more people, and then those viewers must watch in full to choose the next adventure. It’s a brilliant scheme that works just like compound interest, except you’re accumulating valuable Watch Time instead.
‘APKAEIASAAS’: A Channel That Takes Advantage of YouTube Shorts
APKAEIASAASis aMinecraftchannel that earned 425K subscribers and 50M views in just three months.Minecraftis a crowded YouTube niche, so how on Earth was this possible?
YouTube Shortshad a lot to do with it. This new content type requires videos to be vertical and less than 60 seconds long, just like the content you'd see on TikTok.
But right now, not enough creators are making YouTube Shorts. There are more than 2B monthly users on YouTube, which means there’s a huge opportunity for short video creators to stand out - and that’s exactly what APKAEIASAAS did.
This creator posted YouTube Shorts depicting impressive builds in Minecraft’s mod-centric world. The content probably went viral because the YouTube app has a Shorts carousel that plays nothing but short videos. Chances are, APKAEIASAAS’sMinecraftcontent got featured there, earning the channel thousands of views.
Take a look at this Short from APKAEIASAAS. It has 15M views, which is an insane amount of notoriety for one video.
As a creator, you can't ignore the power of short video content. It’s everywhere now, so if you want to get more views on YouTube, start posting some irresistible YouTube Shorts.
‘Matt Talks Tech’ Doubles Down On a Winning YouTube Strategy
Matt Talks Techjoined YouTube in 2012 but didn’t publish a video until 2019. And even then, he experimented on the platform to decode how it works and what his niche would be.
But when hedidfigure things out, everything changed. He found a successful YouTube strategy, cranked up his consistency, and started earning the number of views new creators want to see.
The formula Matt uses is simple. As a tech YouTuber, he titles all of his videos as follows: “Product + Release Date + Price.” So for example, one of his most popular videos is titled, “iPhone 12 Release Date and Price - iPhone 12 Apple Event Date?”
You can watch the video below, which has more than 500K views.
Once this formula was in place, Matt applied it to other product releases. The Google Pixel 5, the iPad Mini 6, the Xbox Series X - it was all fair game.
Matt Talks Tech dominates this strategy now, but it’s nothing you can’t repeat in the future. When you start your channel, pay close attention to what’s working for you. Then stay the course to get more views and subscribers on YouTube.
'Jake Fellman' Creates 3D Animation the World Has Never Seen
In September 2020,Jake Fellmanhad 41K views on his animation channel. Then he discovered YouTube Shorts and started uploading custom, 3D animation videos inspired by a popular game calledAmong Us. The multiplayer game has one objective: Fix a spaceship while avoiding the crew’s deadly, undercover imposter.
Among Usmania has shown no signs of slowing, so Jake seized the opportunity on YouTube. In just 80 days, he gained more than 1M subscribers posting YouTube Shorts filled with 3DAmong Usgameplay.
Want to achieve the same results on your channel? Watch the full case study below to learn more:
Jake is a former 3D motion designer, so he had the technical skills to grow an animation channel. But he has another gift people don’t talk about enough, which is unwavering self-belief. Back in October 2020, Jake said that in a year or less, he’d get 1M followers posting video content. NowJake has achieved that goalby simply being patient and passionate about his craft.
Creators, it’s never too late to share your passions on YouTube. These successful people, who are no different than you, have proven that in 2020. Now that 2021 is here, don’t second-guess yourself. Press record and don’t look back.

Title: 25 vidIQ Tools You Need to Grow Your YouTube Channel NOW!

25 vidIQ Tools You Need to Grow Your YouTube Channel NOW!
What does undeniable, record-smashing YouTube domination look like for you? Is it producing a video that’s optimized so well, it reaches 500,000 views in 30 days? Or is it a matter of studying your competition so closely that you never run out of evergreen video ideas?
No matter what your YouTube goal is, vidIQ has you covered.
It’s hard to grow a YouTube channel without advanced data, analytics, and insights, but we have so many resources to help you! Join over 1 million users who use vidIQ to help them on their YouTube journey.Download the extension todayto kickstart your success and then take a deep-dive into the following features:

1. Real-Time YouTube Analytics Bar​
Sometimes you just need an overview of your channel’s performance without digging too deep for data. Our real-time analytics dashboard does exactly that, plus it's at the top of your homepage for easy access.
In the screenshot above, the dashboard shows:
To make more details appear, hover your mouse over the dashboard to see additional metrics, such as your channel’sWatch Timeover the last week. And if you want to see even more stats on the dashboard, you have the option to add several. The real-time stats bar is customizable!
2. YouTube Likes to Dislikes Ratio Counter
Want an easy way to gauge viewer sentiment? A good way to start measuring this stat is to look at the ratio of likes to dislikes on your videos.
Unfortunately, YouTube itself only counts the number of likes and dislikes. If you wanted to find the overall percentage of likes to dislikes, you’d have to do some math, and well… who has time for that?
With our tool, this percentage appears right beside videos that publicly display likes and dislikes. That way, you can quickly gauge the sentiment viewers have toward a video and gain some valuable insight about your content.
3. YouTube Video Scorecard​
When you watch a video and have vidIQ installed, you'll see the comprehensive scorecard shown above. It has several sections, and you can minimize each one or hide the whole scorecard using the master controls at the top.
Also, the tabs at the top of the scorecard show the historical performance of any video. With this feature, you can review in-depth metrics, such as video views per hour and social reach on Twitter.
4. YouTube SEO Score​
SEO is an important part of being discovered on YouTube. To help you do this, we’ve developed an SEO tool that grades your videos and shares basic steps to make your content more searchable.
Based on the title, description, and tags associated with your video, the SEO tool scores the quality of your metadata. A score closer to 100 means your video is properly optimized and will perform well on YouTube.
Many of the panels in this tool contain extra information about your video’s SEO. To see actionable improvements any creator can make, spend some time exploring these finer details.
5. YouTube Video Views Comparison Tool
Want to track the performance of your videos? Take our video comparison tool for a spin. This wonderful dashboard lets you analyze the performance of the video you’re watching against other valuable metrics.
For example, you might want to know the average video views for an entire channel. In the screenshot above, the comparison tool shows that one video (the blue line) performed below a channel’s average (the pink line). As the blue line slopes upward, you can see that the video steadily gained more views within a period of 28 days.
That suggests the video in question is evergreen content. If you want to take things a step further, you can use the dropdown menu to compare the video you're watching against another channel, your channel, or any other video on YouTube.
6. Video Tags Copy Tool
If a creator has done their keyword research, it’s likely they've added some valuable terms to their video tags, as shown above. Wouldn’t it be great if you could copy this information and add it to your own research?
Well, you’re in luck! That’s exactly what our video tags tool does. Thanks to the paperclip icon in this panel, you can copy and save these valuable keywords onto your computer.
Oh, and if you're wondering what the numbers beside the keywords represent, the innermost number shows how high or low the video you’re watching ranks on YouTube for that search term. Finally, the outermost number is vidIQ’s keyword score.
7. YouTube Search Panel
On a YouTube search results page, this panel appears on the right side and shows you loads of interesting data. Of course, if it’s too overwhelming, you can hide and expand the panel as you see fit.
However, we think you’re going to love having this tool around. The data in this panel shows how often videos for a search term get recycled, as well as which creator appears most often in the search rankings. Chances are, that creator is doing the right things on YouTube. It would be wise to follow them, watch their content, and pick up some useful strategies of your own.
8. YouTube Keyword Score Tool​
We mentioned this keyword score tool earlier, but let’s go into more detail. In a nutshell, it analyzes the volume of a search term against the volume of content on YouTube. Think of it as basic supply and demand. Ideally, you, as a creator, want to make content for a search term that’s in demand with little competition from other YouTubers. The closer this keyword score is to 100, the more opportunity there is for you to rank highly.
9. YouTube Subscriber Counts For Other Channels
Another cool thing vidIQ shows you are channel subscriber counts. Why is this useful? Well, for example, let’s say you stumble upon a Fortnite video with a quarter of a million views. You’re immediately interested in this accomplishment because you have a Fortnite channel too - the only difference is your videos aren’t attracting massive views. So, you investigate. And in the end, you discover that this channel has a mere 6,000 subscribers.
Obviously, that creator found a way to rank for one of the most competitive search terms on YouTube, Fortnite. As a competitor, it would be wise to research what they did so you can repeat their success.
10. YouTube Keyword Research Tool​
If you want to do some deep keyword research, this is the tool for you. It helps you build a better keyword strategy by showing every single tag associated with a video. While it is true that video tags aren't as important as they used to be, keyword research is still vital.
Like the video tag tool, this feature allows you to copy the tags you need for your research. Beyond that, you can also click on an individual video tag to learn more about it. This unravels the keyword universe surrounding a topic and even shows trending videos for the term.
Again, you'll see a vidIQ keyword score beside these terms. Also, you can highlight any keywords of interest to copy and use for your own content.
Once you’ve done all the research, put yourself in the mind of your target audience. What do they search for on YouTube? Before you even press record, you can use these tools to get the answer.
11. YouTube Channel Research Tool​
With the channel research tool, you can view stats about a channel when you visit its homepage. This gives you a performance snapshot that includes video views per hour, subscriber rank, and how many videos they’re published within any date range. You can see this and more by clicking the stats button on the uppermost menu.
The trending button shows a different set of data. With this feature, you can see which content on the channel is performing well right now, as it sorts videos by views per hour. All of this reveals key insights into content that was created months or even years ago. If you happen to discover any videos that are still popular today, that’s another sign of evergreen content.
12. YouTube Channel Keywords Tool​
Want to see the top YouTube keywords a channel is using? You can get a list of these terms using another tool we’ve developed to advance your research. To see what the feature looks like, check out the screenshot above.
Of course, this is a somewhat chaotic reflection of the keywords used for a tech-heavy channel. To make things easier on yourself, press the download button to get a CSV data file showing how often this creator uses such keywords (plus the keyword score).
13. YouTube Channel CSV Report​
Here’s another power tool for you to try and enjoy: the CSV export. For serious creators who need as much data as possible, this tool will download all the public data associated with a channel. Be prepared to go through the numbers with a very, very fine-tooth comb.
14. YouTube Channel Competitors Tool​
The competitors tool allows you to keep tabs on creators within your niche. If they’re reaching success using a topic you make content about, you need to know about it to create some popular content of your own!
When using this tool, you can adjust the timeframe of the videos and how they’re sorted, whether that’s by views per hour, total views, or date uploaded. As with a channel page, you can view the keywords that these creators are using. If several creators are using the same keywords, it's more evidence that you really need to dig into the keyword research that surrounds it.
Think of the competitor tool as an alternative subscription list for when you're in creator mode. You can use the ‘Add Competitor’ button on any channel page to add creators to your list. Alternatively, if you're watching a video and you want to add a channel to your competitor list, click the vidIQ tool button to do it directly from there.
15. YouTube Video Trend Alerts​
Our trend alert tool tracks the most important keywords you want to monitor on YouTube. By setting up filters, you’ll be notified by email when videos containing a certain keyword trigger a predetermined number of views per hour.
In this example above, we created a very simple trend alert for videos about the iPhone. When new videos on the iPhone get over 100 views per hour over a certain time period, an email will arrive in our inbox. From the data shared there, we could start investigating, researching, and even creating if we decided we could add value to the conversation.
16. Most Viewed YouTube Videos Tool
We all know what YouTube's trending page does and doesn't do, right? So, what if you had a tool that simply showed you the most viewed videos on YouTube right now, period?
Let’s say your niche is Fortnite, yet again. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a tool that filters the most viewed Fortnite videos on YouTube? And wouldn’t it be double nice if it could show you the most viewed Fortnite videos on YouTube from channels with less than 1,000 subscribers?
Our most-viewed video tool does all those things. It’s capable of much more, but these are just a few examples of its detailed precision.
17. YouTube Video Manager Tool
Let’s move on to the YouTube Studio now. Whenever you access the video manager screen, a vidIQ tool button presents a range of bulk options for you. We've already seen what the CSV export can do, but there are additional tools for editing content.
For example, this tool will load a list of videos and allow you to edit titles and descriptions on the fly. You can also mass edit video info cards and end screens from a pop-up screen rather than making changes in each video. If you have hundreds of videos on your channel, which many creators do, this will save you hours of repetitive work.
But that's not the only feature this tool has. Mouse over any video, and you’ll discover a second button that lets you do even more.
For example, you can copy info cards or end screens from one video, then transfer them to your other videos in seconds. Imagine how long it would take to do this manually! Even more tools lie beneath this button too, including a quick thumbnail editor.
In short, you'll find this button all over YouTube once you have vidIQ installed. It does different things depending on where you are on the platform, so explore it freely!
18. YouTube Thumbnail Preview Tool
It’s nice to be able to preview your content, isn’t it? If you’ve wondered what a video’s thumbnail will look like before it’s published, this tool is for you.
The thumbnail preview tool is available to use when you upload or edit a YouTube video. In addition to revealing the quality of your titles and thumbnails, this tool compares your video to others that are already ranked for a search term. You can also compare how a video would look on a YouTube home screen as opposed to desktop or mobile.
So, does your video outshine the competition? This is your opportunity to find out before you press publish.
19. Optimum Post Time Tool
When is the best time to publish your YouTube video? Well, the answer is different for all creators, but this tool will provide you with some insight into that question. It observes your subscriber's activity on YouTube, such as when they subscribe to channels and when they like videos. With that information, vidIQ can tell you when your audience is on YouTube. You can then schedule your content to go live when viewership is at its peak.
20. Video SEO Score and Checklist
We’ve already mentioned a tool that reports a video’s SEO score, which appears on video watch pages. This particular tool is the same thing, except it’s specifically for analyzing your videos. This SEO score helps you optimize your video’s title, description, and tags so it has more discoverability on YouTube. The second tab on this panel is your video checklist. It contains all the things you should be doing to give your video the greatest chance of success.
21. Controversial Keywords Checker
This tool is pretty straightforward. To help you avoid demonetization or restricted ads on your content, our keyword checker alerts you when controversial words in your titles, descriptions, or tags may scare advertisers away.
22. YouTube Keyword Recommendation Tool
Whenever you feed keywords into your titles, descriptions, and tags, vidIQ will churn the data in the background, then offer suggestions for titles and descriptions.
These suggestions are based on what’s performing well on YouTube today. And you'll find that once you reach the tag box, the bottom of the upload, or the video editor page, vidIQ has hundreds of recommendations. In one click, you can add each of them to your video’s metadata.
While tags aren't as important as they used to be, this tool makes the process so much smoother.
23. YouTube Custom CommentTemplates
You may have noticed that YouTube occasionally provides automated responses to comments. That’s a useful resource to have, but what if you could create custom template replies? With our comment tool, you can tailor your responses to the questions you always get asked on your channel. Best of all, each one is personalized to include the commenter's name.
So, there you have it - another vidIQ button with almost unlimited community power.
24.YouTubeChannel Audit Dashboard
If you want an instant YouTube report card, then the channel audit tool is for you. It shows you a snapshot of your channel’s performance followed by segmented metrics grouped together for videos that are performing well right now - videos with the most views, Watch Time, and more.
The idea behind this tool is to show you, at a glance, what's working on your channel and encourage you to make more of what your audience is craving. And that's not all. The channel audit tool also shows you how people are discovering your content through search terms, how successful your end screens and info cards are, what's not working on your channel, and all of the loose ends you need to tighten.
25.YouTubeChannel Achievements Tool
As a creator, you're always aiming toward a new YouTube goal, right? Or perhaps you've hit another YouTube milestone and just want to bask in the glory for a bit?
Either way, the vidIQ achievements tool will show you exactly where you are on your journey. At the very top, it predicts your next milestone and when you're likely to reach it. Further down, you can see your latest YouTube achievements and your best months on YouTube.
Ready to share the good news? Click on any achievement you've already reached and vidIQ will generate a certificate you can print or share socially.
As you can see, we’re creator-obsessed at vidIQ. We’re always developing new tools to help creators smash their YouTube goals, but we want to hear from you - what should we release next? Tweet us@vidIQto share your thoughts.

Title: How This YouTube Creator Got 1.5 Billion Views In Just 80 Days

How This YouTube Creator Got 1.5 Billion Views In Just 80 Days
Jake ticks all the boxes for enviable YouTube success. In less than three months, the former 3D motion designer has achieved impressive goals, including:
Back in September 2020,Jake's channelonly had 41K total views. But somewhere along the way, he decided to post his first YouTube Short, which are vertical videos of less than 60 seconds.
After watching the first Short go viral, he decided to post dozens more.

In each of the videos, Jake's 3D characters re-enact scenarios from the wildly popular game,Among Us.The goal of the game is to fix a spaceship while avoiding the crew's deadly, knife-wielding imposter.
Jake's most popular video has 88M views and shows players voting an imposter off theAmong Usspaceship:
Jake’s meteoric rise to success is what every creator wants. But more than that, creators want the perfect opportunity to get there - a tool for content discovery they can pour their efforts into.
So far,YouTube Shortsare providing that opportunity. They worked for Jake, and if you take the right approach, they can work for you too.
To understand how Jake snagged millions of views, we asked him to share some analytics from his YouTube channel. If you want to grow your channel fast, here’s the inspiring blueprint behind his success.
1. Make Content Viewers Can’t Find Anywhere Else
YouTube is a competitive platform. To stand out from the crowd, you need to give your audience something fresh and exciting. It has to be content they can’t find anywhere else, and that’s why Jake’s 3D renditions ofAmong Usgameplay worked. No one was expecting his videos, but at the same time, millions of people are consumingAmong Uscontent right now. So whenever possible, capitalize on a trend in unexpected ways to get more views.
Jake did this by identifying a unique opportunity in posting YouTube Shorts. He realized he could dominate the platform with 30-second videos because everyone else was posting minutes ofAmong Uscontent.
To help you understand why this works so well, we filmed a deep-dive video about Jake’s channel growth. Watch it below to gain more insight:
Like Jake, plentyAmong UsYouTubers are also animators. But obviously, their videos are several minutes long. So Jake isn’t the first person to explore the idea, but heisone of the first to do it in a fresh way, abbreviated way.
2. When You See Early Signs of Success, Double Down On What You Got You There
Jake’s channel didn’t always have a billion views. In fact, his early content on YouTube attracted about 500 views per video.
Back then, Jake was doing what we recommend to new creators: Post useful, educational content to quickly stand out on YouTube. When you browse Jake’s channel, you’ll find dozens of early how-to videos about a 3D animation program called Maya.
However, everything changed when he posted a YouTube Short. From the moment he saw the first one go viral, Jake got to work creating 50 more. Viewers keep returning to watch his Shorts, but that wouldn’t be possible if Jake didn’t create more of what people liked.
Actually, the fact that viewers “liked” his content may be an understatement. They probably loved it. In the screenshot below, you can see that on average, viewers watch 85% of every video he posts (which is pretty high):
And now, take a look at the average number of videos each viewer watched on Jake's channel:
Amazingly, the average viewer on Jake’s channel watches 6.5 videos. To understand how phenomenal that is, compare it to the vidIQ channel. Our average viewer only watches 1.7 videos!
When you see positive growth on your channel, investigate it. Try to understand what happened and how you can turn random success into consistent victories. Then double down on what works!
3. Make Content Anyone In The World Can Enjoy
If your content doesn’t rely on any specific language, it can capture a global audience. That’s part of the reason Jake’s YouTube Shorts are so successful. They can be enjoyed anywhere by anyone, which makes hisAmong Usvideos highly accessible.
Jake’s videos are popular in Indonesia, the U.S., Brazil, India, and Vietnam. In the screenshot below, you can see what percentage of his audience is watching in these regions:
As great as this tip is, we have to add a disclaimer. Not every creator will find it easy or even possible to create global content. In Jake’s case, animation lends itself to global consumption because the visuals are more important than any language or location.
However, if your content has the ability to go global, give it a try!
4. Develop an Unrelenting Drive to Succeed On YouTube
YouTube Shorts may be full of opportunity, but that doesn't mean they’re easy videos to make. Creators like Jake put a lot of time, energy, patience, and skill into these less-than-a-minute videos.
When we asked Jake about his video-making process, he said it takes between five and eight hours to make less than 30 seconds of animation. He earned millions of views in exchange, but how many creators have the perseverance to do the same?
Today, it’s pretty clear that getting millions of views on YouTube takes more than just practical skills. You need to have the mindset of a creator, one who follows trends and is dedicated to studying their audience.
Perhaps another factor is shameless self-belief. Over a year ago, Jake told his LinkedIn followers that one day, he’d get 1M TikTok followers making video content. Today,his TikTokhas 3.4M followers.
This is the kind of determination every creator needs to have. If you can believe in yourself enough to keep creating, you’ll eventually succeed.
Jake’s inspiring story is one to study in 2021. Explore his blueprint for YouTube success, then tweak it to create a plan that earns you millions of views.

Title: How to Get More Views on YouTube Before Publishing Anything

How to Get More Views on YouTube Before Publishing Anything
As a YouTube creator, you know that video thumbnails are a vitally important part of your content strategy. Depending on how yours look, they can seriously make or break the performance of your videos - no matter how informative or entertaining they are.
With everyone aiming to make the best thumbnails possible, sometimes it’s hard to stand out in YouTube search results. If your thumbnails aren’t colorful, eye-catching, and easy to digest, you may earn fewer views than your channel is capable of.
That’s why every creator should have avideo preview toolfor comparing thumbnails, and luckily, we’ve developed one right here at vidIQ. Watch our latest video about how to leverage this amazing tool below:

Our thumbnail preview tool has one goal, and that’s giving your content the best chance of being discovered on YouTube. When you’re ready to start raking in the views, here’s how it works.
How to Use the Video Preview Tool
To access our new thumbnail preview tool, follow these three important steps:
Next, type in the search term you would like to rank for and click ‘Preview in search results’. Instantly, you’ll see a mock-up of your video, complete with your thumbnail, title, and description of choice. The thumbnail preview tool will then compare this mock-up to videos already ranking for the search term you typed.
Extra Video Preview Features
The process above can help you get more views before you even press publish on a video. And it’s especially useful when you’re competing for a specific search term on YouTube.
But what do you do when YouTube starts recommending your content to random viewers browsing the platform? How can you ensure your thumbnails will perform well in that scenario?
Luckily, we have a solution for that too.
The thumbnail preview tool has two content display options: home screen and search screen. The home screen preview shows you a more random selection of videos, just like you might encounter on your YouTube homepage. Viewing this display helps you determine whether your video can catch someone’s attention when they have no viewing agenda.
To toggle between search and home screen displays, go to the top left corner of the preview tool and click either option, as shown below:
And here are some extra features that make life easier for creators...
With the search tab selected, go to the top right corner of the preview page and click ‘Highlight search term.’ This helps you quickly find your target search term on the screen, as shown below:
In the home screen mode, go to the top right corner of the page and click ‘Compare against competitors’. When enabled, this shows you random videos from channels on your vidIQ competitor list, for extra thumbnail comparison. You can see what this feature looks like below:
On the other hand, you’ll see random videos from your YouTube watch history when this feature is toggled off.
How to Update YouTube Thumbnails and More Using the Preview tool
If the preview tool suggests your title, thumbnail, and description aren’t working, you can change them. Simply navigate to the ‘Your video details’ tab on the right side of the preview page and edit/swap each asset as you see fit.
The video preview tool is available to all vidIQ users to test, but you’ll need vidIQ Boost to unlock full access. But of course, you can always start bydownloading vidIQ for free, testing our video preview tool, and getting more views on your content today.

Title: How to Get More Views from YouTube’s Audience Data Tool

How to Get More Views from YouTube’s Audience Data Tool
When you created your YouTube channel, you probably had an idea of what your videos would be about. Whether you wanted to create Fortnite gaming tutorials, comedic sketches, or hours upon hours of pranks, you at least hadsome idea of which viewers you’d attract.
But here’s a question worth asking yourself:Does your audience know what your channel is about?
It almost seems silly to ask, especially if you’ve been pumping out very specific content. Nonetheless, it’s worth answering to make sure you’re on the right track. For example, if you think your channel is about one topic while your audience thinks it’s about something totally different, that tiny misconception could block your channel’s growth.

Fortunately, a new panel within the YouTube Studio can help. To see if you and your audience are on the same page about the content you create, just keep reading.
YouTube’s ‘Audience Watched’ Panel Is a Data Goldmine
Most likely, your audience watches a wide variety of YouTube videos within your niche. To get a glimpse of what that content is - and whether that proves you have a clear, concise channel by comparison - make your way to YouTube’s new audience panel:
You’ll know you’ve reached the panel when you see something that looks like this:
Or, if you need some extra guidance and would rather hear and see the instructions in real-time, watch our video tutorial:
Not Seeing Any Audience Data? Here’s Why
While some of you may see the ‘audience watched’ panel above, a lot of you might not because of a lack of data.
There are a few reasons why no data is appearing in this panel. It might be because you're violating YouTube’s Community Guidelines or your content is made for kids, which means YouTube won’t collect any audience information. But most likely, it’s because you don't have enough data on your YouTube channel.
To get a more scientific reason for this issue, we went to our beloved vidIQ community to see what their ‘audience watched’ panels look like.
After creating a poll on our Community Tab, we discovered that 13% of creators in our community found the panel and could see some data. Unfortunately, another 18% could see the panel but no data. And much worse, 14% said they couldn't see the panel at all. The remaining 55% chose a throwaway option, which said, "I’m going to vote here to spoil your data." I guess we walked right into that one, but still, it kind of hurt. We laughed it off in the end. Sort of.
This poll tells us less than half of our typical vidIQ audience is able to see this panel (with data). Our typical audience includes channels under 1,000 subscribers, less than 4,000 hours of Watch Time, and any channel working toward YouTube monetization.
So that could be a reason some channels (or yours) have zero data. You might need to increase your channel’s Watch Time so YouTube has enough data to work with.
If You Have Zero Audience Watched Data, Use This vidIQ Tool Instead
If you aren't getting any data from the ‘audience watched’ panel, vidIQ has an alternative. As long as you have vidIQ installed, follow this path to get the data you need:
Free users can see this section, but paid users can click on it and get a full list of videos. This is essentially what YouTube’s ‘audience watched’ tool would have shown you.
How to Use the 'Other Videos Your Audience Watched' Panel
OK, back to the YouTube audience tool itself. This panel shows you what your audience watched on YouTube over the last seven days. At the time of writing, it shows you 15 videos split into three pages, and you can click on either the video title or the channel’s name to view the content. These videos aren’t sorted by age, the number of views, or channel size, but it’s worth looking through all of them if you can.
Now, here comes the real question: Why is this so important? The basic premise is that the content your audience watches on other channels should be the content they enjoy watching on your channel. That’s how YouTube encourages you to use this tool. You can use it to find new video topics, title and thumbnail ideas, and collaboration opportunities.
And here’s the most important thing to know:No matter what you, the creator, think your channel is about, your audience thinks it’s about the topic in your 'audience watched' panel.
How to Research ‘Audience Watched’ YouTube Data
OK, let’s do an experiment using the vidIQ channel. In our ‘audience watched' panel, we should see a list of videos that reflect our target audience.
Here’s what we found:
It's great to see our friends at Think Media on the list. And YouTube is right on the money with a video about how to get your first 1,000 subscribers in 2020. That's the type of content we make, no doubt.
Nick Nimmin is also on the list with a video about haters, trolls, and spammers. We recently did a video onbullying and harassment, so that matches up.
Interestingly, there’s a video about color grading in Adobe Premiere Pro, a video editor. That's something we don't cover on the vidIQ channel, so YouTube doesn't always get it right when it comes to mixed audiences. And finally, another video we're happy to be connected with is fourth on the list: How to get 100 subscribers on YouTube.
But the next two are subscriber battles, which is cause for concern. We’ve tested the topic on the vidIQ channel with great success, gaining tons of subscribers from each video. However, they aren't necessarily what we cover every single day. Instead, we're about YouTube education and growth.
If YouTube suggests this content to our audience, they may be left a little disappointed. Everything else on the list looks pretty good, though. If anything, this panel confirms we should do more videos about how to get a certain number of subscribers, how to grow your channel, how to get 100 subscribers every day, and how to get more views.
Can you see the value of this panel and its data? We've been able to learn so much about our YouTube channel in two minutes.
How to Track YouTube Channels That Share Your Audience
With the new ‘audience watched’ panel, YouTube empowers creators to research the targeted and mixed audiences on their channel. But, guess what? vidIQ has a tool to help you track the audiences you share with other creators.
As mentioned earlier, you can click on any of the videos in this audience watch panel to jump straight to the watch page for that video. Well, you can also do this from our channel audit tool. Once you’re on the watch page, next to the likes and dislikes, you'll see a vidIQ button that looks like this:
Next, click the button to reveal an ‘Add competitor’ menu option. Once you select that, you can add the channel of the video you’re currently watching to your competitor list. That allows you to track their most successful videos via views per hour.
If you share an audience as YouTube already suggests, it's likely you can make similar content. It's more likely to be suggested by YouTube and most importantly, watched and enjoyed by more viewers within that audience.
So, what does your audience think your YouTube channel is about? If you’re not sure, all you have to do is follow the data.

How To Get More Views as a Small YouTube Channel
At vidIQ, we get asked the same question from new creators all the time:How can I get more views and grow my channel? YouTube is so competitive!
You probably weren’t expecting this answer, but we’ve got to say it:YouTube Shorts may be the key to getting discovered on the platform.
If you’re unfamiliar with the new feature, it’s basically YouTube’s way of entering the short video universe. The platform has created an in-app Shorts camera, where creators can record and upload short, vertical videos.

You can access this feature right now if you live in India, as that’s where YouTube is testing the Shorts camera. For everyone else, posting a general YouTube Short requires three simple steps:
Plenty of YouTubers have already published these micro-videos, and we’ve noticed apromising pattern of success. A common scenario is witnessing a previously stagnant video skyrocket to hundreds of views - a strong sign that YouTube is featuring it on the newShort Stories and Videos Shelf. If you want to see what such a feat looks like, watch our latest video about YouTube Shorts:
Now that you have some background knowledge, it’s time to dig deeper. More views are what YouTube dreams are made of, so here’s how to get them with YouTube Shorts.
Small Channels Are Getting More Views With YouTube Shorts
As a creator, it’s important to boldly test new strategies on your channel. After all, you never know what positive discoveries you could make - whether that’s a gateway to more views, subscribers, or both.
Pokemaniac_101is a good example of this. A few weeks ago, this was just another small gaming channel struggling to gain traction with long-form videos. That partially ended when they decided to test YouTube's short video format and earned thousands of views in the process. The screenshot below shows a bunch of successful videos highlighted in red, plus the low-performing ones this channel was previously uploading.
Of course, this isn’t all good news forPokemaniac_101. Unfortunately, they tried posting another short video that didn't perform as well as the others. After that, the channel returned to posting long-form content with equally disappointing results, but hey - that comes with the territory of testing new features.
Despite those hiccups,Pokemaniac_101was definitely getting more views from YouTube Shorts, if only for a brief moment.
GamingDestinyhad a similar experience. This channel reached out to us on Twitter and said that after creating a new YouTube channel and uploading a short video, hundreds of views rolled in, as shown below.
If you've ever started a YouTube channel from scratch, you know how difficult it is to get a mere 100 views on your first video. We checked GamingDestiny’s main channel, and again, there was more evidence of short, vertical videos outperforming other content.
We received another success story from Adrienne Smith, who shared her YouTube Shorts experience in our Facebook group. Apparently, one of her Shorts with little to no traction suddenly gained more views on YouTube. You can read her testimonial below:
This is great news, but seriously: How often does that happen to anyone? Is it just another coincidence?
YouTube Shorts and YouTube Analytics: Is There a Connection?
We’re not prepared to say YouTube Shorts is the next big thing. The examples above only represent a small handful of channels, and they’re only getting hundreds of views - not thousands.
However, these channels have a few things in common:
When you see such a high volume of direct or unknown views as a YouTube traffic source, it can be slightly alarming. But when three channels experience the same surge after testing YouTube Shorts, that's a pattern worth exploring.
We Still Have Questions About YouTube Shorts
YouTube hasn’t shared much information when it comes to Shorts. This lack of access can be frustrating for creators, and because of that, we’ve got lots of questions, such as:
If you’re a smaller creator, we have enough proof to finally say what many creators want to hear: Yes, you can get more views posting YouTube Shorts. But as for the future of short videos, such as monetization, Watch Time, and other factors, we’ll have to wait and see if YouTube announces any benefits.

Virtual Halloween 2020: Top Keywords on YouTube

This year’s Halloween is going to look much different than 2019’s door-to-door conquest for candy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasdiscouraged traditional trick-or-treatingduring COVID-19, so many are turning online for entertainment and inspiration.
That means we’re going to experience the strangest, most digitally-reconfigured Halloween of all time. In lieu of trick-or-treating through spooky neighborhoods, brands like Mars-Wrigley have created virtual experiences to help families celebrate from home.

One of these is a mobile app calledTreat Town, which gamifies the joy of trick-or-treating. The goal of the game is to get people to give you digital credits for buying real candy, and players achieve that by decorating an attractive virtual door. Of course, that’s not the only example of this year’s virtual Halloween. Costume contests and Halloween parties are appearing across the web, too.
If you’re an up-and-coming YouTuber, your ‘content senses’ should be tingling right about now. With all these new ways to celebrate Halloween, plus the fanfare of older traditions, you could get tons of views from timely content.
Need some ideas to get started? Read this guide for the top keywords and content ideas around Halloween 2020.
Top YouTube Keywords for Halloween 2020
Using the right keywords in your titles and descriptions is crucial for getting more views on YouTube. According to thevidIQ keyword tool, a top Halloween keyword with only moderate competition is ‘Halloween 2020’. This term has a monthly search volume of 275,899 on YouTube. Here are nine other terms to keep in mind as you create content:
Animal Crossing and Halloween 2020 Are a Thing
Did you catch the last keyword in our list above? ‘Animal Crossing Halloween update’ is a trending keyword right now, and that’s mostly due to a fall update of the popular game. It’s also proof that Halloween and gaming are merging paths this year to become one virtual experience.
If you paste ‘Animal Crossing Halloween update’ into YouTube’s search bar, you’ll find recent videos with hundreds of thousands of views. Some of them explain everything you need to know about the "Animal Crossing" update, and some showcase beautiful yet spooky islands players have designed.
And then there are videos like the one below, which is a short tutorial on how to buy Halloween costumes and candy in "Animal Crossing":
This video byDanieG Gaming(6.61K subscribers) is worth mentioning because it has more than 8K views. If you scroll through their channel, you’ll see that most videos earned between 300 and 3,000 views. So in terms of attracting more viewers and growing a channel, DanieG Gaming’s "Animal Crossing" tutorial was a success. Of course, that success is repeatable if you’re willing to hop on this Halloween trend.
Spirit Halloween 2020 on YouTube: Shopping, Decor, and Costumes
Let’s take a step back and talk about ‘Halloween 2020’. Our star keyword with 275,899 monthly searches is fair game for creators. But there’s a similar keyword to that one gaining some traction, and that’s ‘Spirit Halloween 2020’, which refers to the popular U.S. Halloween store. According to the vidIQ keyword tool, competition for this keyword is low and the search volume is just under 60,000 per month. That's not as high as 'Halloween 2020's' search volume, but smaller creators may benefit from reduced competition around 'Spirit Halloween 2020'.
You can find proof of this on a channel calledThe Wild Ride. With only 1.79K subscribers, this creator has managed to get tens of thousands of views on Spirit Halloween shopping videos, like the one below:
This shopping adventure attracted 28K views, which is impressive for a channel that’s only two months old. It’s possible that using ‘Spirit Halloween 2020’ in the title helped the video take off. If you dig through The Wild Ride channel, you’ll see that most of their popular videos contain some variation of that keyword.
But what if you wanted to focus on creating Halloween costumes instead of shopping for Halloween materials? No problem. Channels likeK&T Do Halloweenare doing exactly that using the ‘Spirit Halloween 2020’ keyword. The only difference is they’re doing epic costume makeovers of spooky animatronic props, like this one:
K&T Do Halloween only has 10K subscribers, but with the right keyword, the video above managed to attract a quarter of a million views.
If you like shopping at Spirit Halloween, try to come up with unique video ideas around that. As you can see from the examples above, the keyword is hot right now and channels of various sizes are reaping the benefits.
Ultimately, you have two options for YouTube success this Halloween: You can address the virtual side of the holiday or stick to the traditional celebrations we all know and love. Either way, you have the opportunity to get more YouTube views as people stay safe at home this spooky season.

Title: What is Cottagecore and Why is it Taking Over Social Video?

What is Cottagecore and Why is it Taking Over Social Video?
Do you like foraging for wild berries? Baking bread? Working with your hands to make stoneware pottery? Then perhaps you’ll also like Cottagecore, an aesthetic that romanticizes agricultural and domestic life from an era long ago.
Cottagecore (AKA Farmcore, Countrycore, Grandmacore, Witchcore, and other variations on a theme)has blown up online this year, but underneath the viral glitz and glam, this trend is a nod to simpler times. In some of the most chaotic and demanding months most of us have ever lived through, this content has proved something of a digital sanctuary.
Cottagecore celebrates traditional crafts, such as cross stitching, rustic baking, and handwritten poetry, plus outdoor pursuits such as gardening. Influencers across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Tumblr, are encouraging the trend by posting nostalgic photosets and calming countryside clips.

Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cottagecore has gone way beyond the aesthetic. Lockdown created the perfect conditions for slowing down, and in response, many people have embraced older household crafts. In March, one of those nostalgic tasks was baking sourdough bread from scratch.
It became such a popular trend that quarantiners boughtastonishing amounts of flourto bake away their isolation woes. And although influencers are driving the views, some big-name publishers likeNetflixand Twisted have jumped on the bandwagon:
But what does all this mean for YouTube creators? Well, Cottagecore has been growing in popularity for a while now. It’s evolved from aTumblr subcultureto something many people know about, which means it might be a trend worth capitalizing on. Want to explore the possibilities? Here are the top keywords and content ideas we’ve seen:
Top 10 Cottagecore Keywords on YouTube
According to thevidIQ keyword tool, more than 200,000 people searched for ‘Cottagecore’ on YouTube in the past month. That’s an extremely high search volume, which means now’s a good time to post that kind of content.
To help you reach more viewers, here are nine additional keywords to use in video titles, descriptions, and tags.
Cottagecore Meets Animal Crossing
Another thing we’ve noticed about the trend is just how popular it is with “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” fans. If you’re not familiar with the game, it’s a simulation where players turn a deserted island into a lively community of animal friends. Along the way, gamers play as a character that decorates the island with furniture, flowers, bridges, plazas, and more.
Unsurprisingly, this created tons of design opportunities for fans. On YouTube, some creators are uploading videos where they tour Cottagecore-themed islands designed by various gamers.
TakeLiss the Lass, for example. In one of her videos, she toured a Cottagecore island with large pink and red flowers, densely wooded areas, and cobblestone pathways. Her tour guide was@kaylee_acnh, who designed the entire oasis and used her “Animal Crossing” character to show Liss the Lass’ character around the island. Watch the tour below to see her beautiful haven:
The most exciting thing about this video - other than the gorgeous island - is that more than 200,000 people watched it. Liss the Lass has 12.9K subscribers, which proves even an up-and-coming channel can use trending topics to get more views on YouTube.
Creative Cottagecore Lookbooks Are Popping Up on YouTube
Cottagecore isn’t just about spending time in nature and doing traditional crafts. It’s also an aesthetic, and YouTube creators have taken the trend to the next level with fashion hauls and lookbooks.
Anna Shishmanov’slookbook is the perfect example. Back in May, she uploaded a video of her modeling three outfits while wandering through flower fields and forest trails. It’s one of the best lookbooks out there, so take a few minutes to watch her calming, farm-style video:
Did you see the dainty overalls? The sandals from another era? It’s safe to say Anna nailed this look. Her video highlights the important parts of Cottagecore fashion, which are:
Like Liss the Lass, Anna has a small but growing YouTube channel of 3.46K subscribers. Yet somehow (because keywords!), her Cottagecore video has amassed more than 55K views.
So now you know: Cottagecore is a lovely YouTube trend that even the newest or smallest creators can capitalize on. All it takes is the great outdoors, a farm-style aesthetic, and bam - you’ve got a video in the making.

Title: How Creators Can Get More Views With YouTube Shorts

How Creators Can Get More Views With YouTube Shorts
If you haven’t heard of YouTube Shorts yet, it's a new feature that lets creatorsupload videos of 15 seconds or lessand add special, TikTok-style effects to their content.
Eligible creators can access the Shorts camera in the YouTube app, but for everyone else, uploading a vertical video under 60 seconds with the hashtag #Shorts achieves the same thing.
To learn more about the feature, read our blog post on “YouTube Shorts: What We Know About How They Work.” It shares some early testing results of YouTube Shorts, how to create your own, and predictions for the future.

However, if you've been following us for a while, you know what Shorts are, and that we started avidIQ Shorts channelto test the feature. We've also posted some of these shorts on our main channel.They’re doing well so far, and we’ve heard similar stories of success from other YouTube creators.
To witness their testimonies, watch our latest video about how YouTube Shorts is affecting creators:
When we first analyzed YouTube Shorts, we didn’t have enough data to know whether they’d hurt or help creators on the platform. We didn’t know if they’d cause a decrease in channelWatch Timeor if viewers would unsubscribe after watching short videos they never asked for.
To some extent, we still don’t know how bad the outcome could be. But for now, despite some unknowns, we know YouTube creators are getting more views with YouTube Shorts.
How to Analyze Your YouTube Shorts Performance
Let’s start our YouTube Shorts analysis with a video we posted on the main vidIQ channel called, “YouTube Shorts: The @MrBeast Effect.” So far, it's given us the data we need to understand how Shorts are performing.
While you’re here, go ahead and watch it for maximum clarity.
As with any video launched on a channel with many subscribers, most of our initial views came from YouTube notifications. Eventually, this spike in views decreases as dedicated viewers stop watching.
However, our video didn’t follow that script entirely. There was a small boost in views long after uploading, so we had to figure out what was happening. Our theory was that YouTube was featuring the video on its Stories and Short Videos shelf.
This is a newer feature in the app that lets viewers explore short content in a never-ending, TikTok-style format. To learn more about how that works, read our blog post, “Can You Get 1 Million YouTube Views By Making Short Videos?”
To confirm whether our video was being featured, we opened the YouTube Studio and viewed the traffic sources list. Many creators hypothesized that views from the Stories and Short Videos shelf showed up as direct or unknown views, which ended up being true. In fact, while viewing our real-time analytics, we found a surge in direct or unknown views for our short video. That means it was being discovered on YouTube’s new shelf.
Just to confirm, we didn’t post the Short on social media, YouTube’s community tab, or anywhere else. To make sure our data was conclusive, we made zero attempts to boost the video’s views.
How to Optimize a YouTube Short
Optimizing a short video isn’t too different from optimizing a normal YouTube video. For each YouTube Short, we made sure to:
However, those things don’t impact whether your video appears as a Short. And as many creators have shared, it takes days before YouTube decides to test (or feature) a video on the Stories and Short Videos shelf, where exposure leads to more views.
The big takeaway is YouTube Shorts don’t perform like normal videos, where the first 48 hours are crucial for getting more views.The video could take off at any time in the first couple of weeks.
Testimonials and Lessons From Creators Using YouTube Shorts
We told the vidIQ community about YouTube Shorts before they even had a name, so creators have had a few weeks to test the feature. And interestingly, there are plenty of success stories.
For example,GettinJigglyWitIthas nearly 600 subscribers and got 11K views on a Shorts video. Read what they had to say about that experience below:
For those wondering about the aspect ratios of vertical videos, Interesting Igloo is having success with the 9:16 format. This channel also pointed out that Mr. Beast is using the same format for his Shorts, as shown below:
Jon Dunkerleyis going all-in with the new feature and started a Shorts channel about his funny dog. The new channel only has 10 subscribers, but he's getting 400 views on some of his shorts. Read more on that below:
LeigerGaminggave YouTube Shorts a try and one of their videos suddenly collected more direct and unknown views before normalizing again. One interesting thing to note is LeigerGaming's thumbnails suit both landscape videos and vertical Shorts. If YouTube ever decides to use custom thumbnails in the Shorts shelf, that decision could pay off. Check out LeigerGaming’s thumbnail and comment below:
Nicksbankrpt told us a video of his from March 2019 recently took off with 1,000 views. We asked him to check the traffic sources and they all came from direct or unknown views, as shown below:
Wealth Insiders is gaining subscribers from YouTube Shorts, which is an interesting outcome. Check out their comment below:
Despite this channel’s success, there is a danger to testing YouTube Shorts on your main channel. For one, you're testing your audience's patience with completely different content. Many viewers subscribe to a channel expecting videos of several minutes, possibly more - and not all of them want to see shorter content.
Although the YouTube Shorts we’ve tested on our main channel are getting decent views, they do seem to be ticking off subscribers. We’ve lost a few whenever we post a Short, so that’s one analytic to keep an eye on.
Insider Secrets About YouTube Shorts
Our last testimonial is probably the most interesting. It’s fromYeti's Place, and that channel’s comment recounts a private video meeting with YouTube about how Shorts really work:
This comment suggests:
Many of these points contradict what YouTube is saying publicly about Shorts. For instance, YouTube publicly instructed creators to use the hashtag #Shorts, but this comment suggests it’s not needed.
Whether that’s true, false, or somewhere in between, only time will tell.
Will YouTube Shorts be the next big thing? We don’t know for sure. But we can confirm YouTube Shorts is no longer a mild curiosity for the platform. It’s definitely a real, concrete thing. And while TikTok continues to be in turmoil, YouTube Shorts has the potential to keep growing.

Title: Can You Get 1 Million YouTube Views By Making Short Videos?

Can You Get 1 Million YouTube Views By Making Short Videos?
But before we talk about short videos of 60 seconds or less and how that could change YouTube forever, let’s do a quick test. To see if you have YouTube’s latest short-video feature, follow these steps:
Here at vidIQ, we’re seeing something we’ve never seen before on YouTube, and it looks something like this:
We believe that his new shelf, ‘Stories and Short Videos’, is YouTube’s way of testing short video on its app. Back in 2019, the platform announced the test on its support page, claiming it was “running an experiment to display vertical videos, under 30 seconds, alongside YouTube Stories on mobile.” And of course, YouTube would be “looking forward to feedback” about this new feature.

Well, we’ve had some time to test this new shelf, and yes, we do have some feedback! The feature is still new, but our early assessment is that it could drive video discovery. We’ve got tons of questions swirling around in our heads about this, such as, “Can you get a million views if your short video appears on this shelf?” And, “What’s the future of short video on YouTube?”
Now that we’ve tested the feature, we have some answers and predictions to share. But before we do that, watch our latest video explaining YouTube’s short video shelf:’
Why Suggested Videos Are So Important
First of all, let us explain why this new feature interests the experts at vidIQ. Typically, successful channels get most of their views from YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. This means the viewer doesn’t do any work to find new videos. Instead, YouTube is actively promoting more content to watch. As a creator, this is exactly what you want because it’s essentially free advertising.
Now, here’s where things get interesting. As we’ve always understood, having a high click-through rate andWatch Timeon your video increases the chance of YouTube suggesting it to viewers. That’s the Playbook creators have lived by for over 15 years: make compelling, click-worthy thumbnails, and once users reach the video watch page, encourage them to stay for as long as possible.
But how do short videos factor into the equation? If YouTube is displaying those in a place where they get watched over and over again, does that translate to viral content? We don’t know the answer for sure, but already we’re seeing short videos with hundreds of thousands of views sitting on YouTube’s new shelf.
Shockingly, the channels posting these videos aren’t always large YouTube powerhouses. Some have less than 5,000 subscribers, which is interesting to say the least.
How Short Video Currently Works on YouTube
OK, let’s dive into the short video shelf itself. To quickly summarize, here’s what you can expect when it comes to short video on YouTube:
Now, let’s clarify a few of these points. First of all, any video on the shelf displaying a video length is a full YouTube video, not a YouTube Story. You can tell the difference between the two by looking at the control icons.YouTube Storieswill always have less buttons to tap than a full YouTube video.
So that's the first piece of good news: YouTube videos and Stories will appear on the shelf together. You don't need to be eligible to post YouTube Stories, which require tens of thousands of subscribers, to have your videos appear on the shelf.
Lastly, instead of testing videos under 30 seconds, YouTube has expanded the limit to 60 seconds.
Some Short Videos Are Getting Massive Views on YouTube
Is it true you can get millions of views on a short video? Let’s do an experiment using one of the most popular YouTubers on the planet,MrBeast. His videos typically get 30 million views in their first week, so let's peruse the suggested videos below his content.
The first thing we noticed was an advertisement - fair enough. Then a MrBeast gaming video, which is to be expected. And then, we finally reached the short video shelf to find this:
Underneath one of MrBeast’s videos, the first short video suggestion is “If Planets Were as Close as the Moon”. This video belongs to Matematike Fizike, a channel with 1.96K subscribers. And guess what? Despite this channel’s size, its short video is doing extremely well. It has more than 14,000 likes, 1,500 comments, and over a quarter of a million views, thanks to some exposure from MrBeast’s fanbase.
Now just think about that for a second. A channel with 1,900 subscribers is being suggested on MrBeast videos that get tens of millions of views. That’s an insane opportunity to grow a channel. And as we kept investigating the random short videos on YouTube’s new shelf, we started to notice some patterns:
To sum things up, we don't think previously popular videos are ending up on the shelf. I think they’re popular now simply because they’re on the shelf, which YouTube seems to populate at random.
Short Videos vs. Longer Videos on YouTube
All this information around short videos leaves us, and likely some creators, with a big question: Should YouTubers forget everything they’ve learned about the platform? Instead of making longer videos with amazing thumbnails, should they make short videos with no thumbnails to target this highly discoverable shelf and get more views? To be honest, we don’t know the answer.
On the one hand, it seems like a lucrative opportunity for creators when it comes to video competition. Up until now, it didn't matter how long your video was or what aspect ratio it was filmed in. Each video had the same chance of finding itself in the suggested videos section.
On the other hand, few creators are making content like this on YouTube. Therefore, if you wanted to, you’d have a nice shot at dominating - or at least appearing on - the short video shelf. There’s less competition because a tiny fraction of YouTube videos meet the vertical, 60-second requirement.
We thought that might change or at least even out when YouTube introduced vertical video in 2018. Heck, we made a video about it and everything:
But alas, landscape is still king.
OK, back to short videos. Imagine this for a moment: Suppose we at vidIQ made a video about how to get1,000 subscribers(which we have). If we made a regular landscape video, we'd be competing against every other video on that topic - potentially millions. But what if we made our video less than 60 seconds, in vertical format? How many videos do you think we'd compete against then? Thousands, maybe even hundreds? Doesn't that sound really tempting?
Let’s dig deeper. As an example, vidIQ is currently on the Watch page of a video titled "How to Get Your First 1,000 Subscribers." And all the suggested videos are what you’d expect - more YouTube growth videos from a familiar set of creators. But consider this: Wouldn't it be fantastic if videos with similar topics appeared on the short video shelf too?
Unfortunately, this is where our confusion begins. Underneath the "How to Get Your First 1,000 Subscribers" video, we noticed some things that make the short video shelf hard to tame, predict, or understand:
So, there it is: With such a spotty selection process, we’re not seeing many ways for creators to strategically get a video on the shelf.
Should You Make Short YouTube Videos?
Because of the reasons mentioned above, our instinct says that you shouldn’t start pumping out short videos. It’s hard to target YouTube’s new shelf, so creating a bunch of vertical, 60-second videos may be a waste of time. However, it doesn’t hurt to test the feature in case YouTube prioritizes short videos.
Personally, we don't think the short video shelf fits within the current YouTube app. And I also don't think users should have to watch a video in the app to get to the shelf. Right now, it's buried too deeply within the current setup.
Instead, this shelf for short videos could be the last testing phase before YouTube unleashes a TikTok-style feature. It’s rumored to be in development, so I wouldn't be surprised if YouTube released a standalone app for short videos in the future. I’m probably 99.9% wrong, but if we're right, you heard it here first!
Having said all that, YouTube’s short video shelf is in a valuable location on the app. If you can make your videos appear there regularly, the sky’s the limit.

Title: 10 Killer Tips to Get More Subscribers on YouTube

10 Killer Tips to Get More Subscribers on YouTube
When you launch your YouTube channel, remember that you are entitled to absolutely nothing, especially subscribers. You need to work hard, and hustle day and night to earn every single view and every single subscriber. On that note, let us give you 10 expert tips that should get you thinking about how to build your super-engaged subscriber fanbase:
#1 Make Building a Relationship With Your Audience a Priority
Subscribers are earned by building up a relationship with your audience, and that can be done in many different ways. Of course, the most obvious one would appear to be on a personal level. You're standing in front of a camera, meaning the audience can connect with you directly, and vloggers certainly will build up subscribers as they tell more of their story.
But it can also be on an educational level. I know of many videos where I've watched something, and I've had that light bulb moment in the video, and that makes me click subscribe immediately. That sort of subscription happens a lot with educational and How To channels. The problem with that is that the user usually just wants a specific answer to a specific question that you gave them, and then, they're not interested in anymore of your content. But that's the nature of YouTube - subscribers can have different values to different people.

I think ultimately, if you can establish a relationship with your audience and build up a certain level of trust, those are going to be your most valuable subscribers who will invest not only in the video that they have just watched, but in future content on your channel. I think all of the tips that you're gonna see in this post relate back to this one.
#2 Double Down on the Video Content That’s Working For You
Now, there is one tried and tested, guaranteed to work shortcut to getting more subscribers, and that's sub for sub.I am kidding, of course, but there is a hack to getting more subscribers faster, and that's to analyze the data on your own channel to see what videos convert videos into subscribers. This can be done through one of the VidIQ tools. It's called the Channel Audit, and when you open it up, there is a section dedicated to videos getting the most subscribers for your channel. It stands to reason if those videos are turning viewers into subscribers, you should do more content on those themes. The Channel Audit, by the way, is part of our huge VidIQ arsenal that will help you research YouTube, analyze videos, audit your channel as you've just seen, and take optimal steps to help grow your channel.It's free to download!.
#3 Be Consistent with Your Upload Schedule - Give Viewers a REASON to Subscribe
Being consistent comes in many different shapes and sizes, but one of the most important ones is consistency of schedule. Make sure you keep posting so people come back to your content, but most importantly, keep consistent in your choice of topic. Let's say it takes three videos to convert a viewer into a subscriber:
If you're jumping from topic to topic to topic, you may never get past the awareness stage of your content. I know this may sound counter productive at this point, but you really need to focus down on one specific topic. The thing that you're most passionate about and that you can tell the best stories about.
#4 Treat Viewers as Guests - Make it Easy for Them to Understand What Your Channel is All About
Consider viewers as your guests, and welcome them warmly into your home. Give them a guided tour so they know where everything is, and those guests will soon become friends. What do I mean by that metaphor? Sort out your channel page! This will include creating a channel banner that visually tells your audience what you do in five seconds, and uploading a channel trailer video that best represents the kind of content that you do.
Also, always create Playlists that help inform the visitor on the topics that you cover and show recent uploads so people know you are still producing content.
#5 Ask Viewers to Subscribe - They Probably Will
Sometimes, you've just got to tell your viewers what to do because they won't do it themselves. There's nothing wrong with occasionally asking for a little bit of help from your audience, and if you do it too much, your audience will let you know. If you've never tried it before, definitely give it a go, and try and make it something fun.
#6 Get Inventive with Calls to Actions (CTAs)
Generally speaking, when you ask your audience to do something, it's what's known as a call to action. But you can be more subtle. You could have graphics appear on screen that you don't even reference. Simply search for 'subscribe animation green screen', and you'll find plenty of free options on the Internet
#7 Get Savvy with Your Branding Watermark
Want to know about something that could increase subscriber growth by 500% - your branding watermark. Many video creators simply use their channel logo. But we recommend using a subscribe button like this because when you mouse over this button on a desktop, you can subscribe to the channel. It does exactly what it says on the tin.
When we switched to this subscriber button, our subscribe rates from that source increased by over 500%! As a free gift to you,here's a link to the image you can use. For more information about how to implement this on your own YouTube channel, check out this video: 'How to Add a Subscribe Button'
#8 Reach Out Via Community Tab & YouTube Stories
Not every video creator can produce videos every single day, but you should still produce content every single day. How? well, if you have more than 1,000 subscribers, you can post status updates, ask questions, post voting polls, and promote videos through theYouTube Community tab. If you only have time to post one video a week, you always have five minutes to post an update on your Community tab.
The same goes forYouTube Storiesif you have access to it. Create short vertical form video clips that you can quickly record to keep your audience up to date with what you're up to. You can even do video responses to questions through this feature, which is pretty awesome for building relationships and establishing trust with your audience.
#9 Help YouTube Engage Non-subscribers!
Now, I know what you're thinking at this point. The Community tab and YouTube Stories are all very well and good for my subscribers, but what difference does that make to non-subscribers? Well, here's the weird thing. Those community posts and YouTube Stories can hit people who have not subscribed to your content but have watched your content or it's related content to what that viewer is interested in. It's true! We post regularly in our Community tab, and we often get comments from users who aren't subscribed to our channel. There's nothing we can do about it, but we do appreciate YouTube reaching out to a new audience on our behalf :-)
#10 Reference Your Subscribers in Your Content
Maybe you don't have access to the Community tab, or to YouTube Stories yet. Fair enough, you still have access to YouTube comments. Youshouldbe responding to every single comment you can, because this all links back to tip number one, building relationships and building trust with your audience. It's always a great feeling for the commenter to know that the video creator is paying attention to what they say and responding to their comments. And we try and do that on VidIQ with every single video that we do. And there's other ways to acknowledge your community, as well, such as referencing them directly in videos. If you can make your audience feel special, there's a much higher chance of them investing in you.

Title: How to Rank for Fortnite on YouTube to Get More Views

How to Rank for Fortnite on YouTube to Get More Views
I assume you're a Fortnite player if you’re reading this post so you’ll want to know how to rank for that content on YouTube, right? Here are 6 ways you can rank for Fortnite topics on YouTube right now:
I think it's fair to say that Fortnite has been going through a downswing in recent months, and we'll come back to that later. But it is still one of the most popular games on YouTube to make videos about. And it helps that new items, and secrets, and seasons are always being announced and released that keep the Fortnite topic fresh with new content on YouTube. And Fortnite season 10 is being released on the 1st of August, 2019.
How to Rank for Fortnite Topics on YouTube Now
Now we have already talked about small YouTube channels trying to find their niche in this huge Fortnite area. And, once again, I have a perfect example. There is something about Fortnite and boosting frames per second that YouTube viewers really get a kick out of. And this enterprising video creator with less than 500 subscribers stuck a video on YouTube a month ago, and now it ranks top of the list with 50,000 views (video has been removed from YouTube).

Now, it's probably a little bit of a creative license with the title there, I mean, how could you make this video when season 10 wasn't released a month ago? But it is getting positive engagement, so the content must be providing value. Also the second channel and video in the search rankings, we've come across this chap before. You might call him the YouTube authority on frames per second boost on Fortnite, because he pivoted his entire channel to the endeavor and has gained tens of thousands of subscribers and millions of views over the past 12 months from it. And how do we know all of this? Well it's because we did a case study on the channel last year. And you canwatch it here.
Jump on the Demand for Trending Fortnite Content
Now that was an example of Evergreen content. It's designed to be relevant and valuable to viewers for awhile, say, two or three months. But what I want to show you now are the extreme gains you can potentially get from trending content that may only have a shelf life of a couple of days.
Now I will confess, I am not a Fortnite player, so I don't know all of the jargon and terminology in the game. But when I did a search on YouTube for Fortnite, this particular video and its title caught my interest.
First and foremost, it's a live stream and the title suggests something is happening right now in the Fortnite universe. Interesting, yes. But what is happening? And what are people likely to be searching for? Season 10 or season X I understand is a new release, but what's this Nexus Orb thing mean? That sounds like the most specific keyword phrase in the title, so I decided to find out what that was all about.
Now forgive me, I'm probably gonna get this explanation a little wrong because I don't play Fortnite. But, as far as I understand it, this orb is integral to the launch of season 10 of Fortnite. People have been seeing it on teaser videos in the last couple of days. It's exploding, it's giving you stuff, it's melting stuff, something along those lines. The bottom line is, for a very short window of time, probably around about 72 hours, everybody who's playing Fortnite wants to know what this orb is and what's gonna happen and they want as much information as possible and they want it now. And that's why that search term has gone through the roof.
How to Find the Best Fortnite Keywords to Use on YouTube
Using vidIQ's own keyword inspector tool, we can click on keywords video creators are using and see how a term is trending over time. As you can see, Nexus Orb didn't even register as a term until a week ago, and now interest is spiking because of what's happening on Fortnite right now. And remember, I'm not a Fortnite gamer. I do not understand how that world works. But with a little keyword research intuition, I've been able to identify at least one keyword phrase that looks particularly juicy and if I was a Fortnite gamer, I would be making a video on it right now.
And you know what? When I have a second look at this title, there is another keyword of interest: Dusty Depot. To be honest, I'm not sure what it means because I'm a complete Fortnite noob. But what I do know through vidIQ is that this is another trending keyword phrase - so let's have a look at the keywords individually first.
We've got Fortnite at the top as your topic. That's not going anywhere, it's been around for years. Now we've got something of relevancy today: Season 10. But a lot of other video creators are gonna be using that. Then we're gonna go really specific with those two keywords that started to trend in the last week because potentially, people didn't realize they were gonna be trending more than a week ago. That's Nexus Orb and Dusty Depot. And what happens when you start to put those keywords together? Well that's when channels of all shapes and sizes can have viral moments.
Take this search that combines Season 10 and Dusty Depot. It may be some way down the search results, but this channel with its 250 subscribers has had its own viral moment from a video with 3,000 views. Of course, in the grand scheme of the Fortnite universe, 3,000 views on a video is not a big deal. But it is for the channel itself. If you are a gaming channel that's trying to find its way on YouTube, and you create a video that does 100 times better than your previous video, that's a signal to create more content on the subject, which the video creator has done. And hey, it may only be 200 views. But for a channel with 250 subscribers, that's still pretty good.
Now if Dusty Depot, when, who thought I would ever say Dusty Depot in a YouTube video, if Dusty Depot is an interesting keyword, then Nexus Orb is a fascinating keyword. First of all, the average age of videos appearing at the top of the YouTube search results is just nine days. This is extremely rare, and it means two things. Not only is the search term very hot, but it also means that YouTube is recycling content frequently because there is a lot of fresh stuff coming onto the platform.
Fortnite Live Streams: The Key to YouTube Success
Now I have a question for you. What do a lot of these videos have in common as I scroll through these search results? Have you spot it yet? Yep! I notice that too. A significant number of these videos are actually live streams. And when I tweak the search term to Nexus Orb event, every single video in the search results was a live stream. Yeah, this isn't a trick, I'm not filtered by live stream only videos. And I'm not sure I've ever seen this before. What all of this tells me from a YouTube perspective is that this Nexus Orb event, was so important to Fortnite gamers that Fortnite video creators wanted to stream the event live to capture as many people as possible as they were searching for this new release. And, when you do a live stream, YouTube favors that in a search term.
So while you're currently live, you will find yourself higher up in the search terms. And we've actually discovered this with our own content. Every Tuesday at 11 A.M. PDT for around about an hour, we do a live stream channel audit. You're welcome to join us next time we're on. And every time we have that live stream running, for the hour, we rank much higher in the search term ‘How to Get More Views’. Because that's part of the title of our live streams. If you don't believe me, next Tuesday, 11 A.M., search for how to get more views and you should find us near the top of the search rankings.
Now in all fairness, there's never going to be a surge of interest for the search term How to Get More Views. But, when there is a trending event that has a very small window of opportunity, 24, 48 hours, perhaps even less, it might be more advisable to do a live stream to capture that event, and then you could take the best bits of that live stream and create a smaller, dedicated, specific video a couple of hours later.
Now, let's step back for a second. Why am I advising you to go after trending topics and potentially do that through live streams? Well remember, Fortnite is a huge gaming topic on YouTube with channels that have tens of millions of subscribers. And you've got to find your own little edge to compete against them.
All of which brings me back to the video that first caught my attention. At nearly 200,000 subscribers, by no means isAyvaka small channel. But it's not a huge one either in the Fortnite grand scheme of things. But by creating a super keyword-rich video, and making it into a live stream, this channel finds itself at the top of the search rankings. And because it's at the top of trending search rankings, there are thousands of people watching it which is pretty incredible for a channel of this size.
BUT, here’s where you have to be careful both as a viewer and a video creator. On closer inspection Ayvak’s livestream was a 15 minute looped video created a couple of days before the event, which YouTube decided was the best livestream to share amongst viewers searching for that topic.
It is unfortunate that there are many video creators who game the YouTube search system in this way. It is your job as a video creator to give you audience something of real worth and value. After further research into the topic we did find genuine livestreamers who were giving their audience great content. Creators such asDotzand his 10 hour livestream that ranked highly for the topic and earned his 20k subscriber channel 65k views:
Livestreams & Trending Topics on YouTube: Capture the Viewer Interest Now!
If you are going to go after a trending topic, and do it as a live stream, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons and you're giving your audience something of value. Now we have used Fortnite as the example here, but you could apply this to any topic on YouTube. For example, the announcement of a new piece of technology such as the next iPhone. A reaction to the latest movie trailer release, or indeed, a wrestling event.
We always get reactions to the latest pay-per-views such as Summer Slam. Can you tell I'm a wrestling addict? Yeah, you can smell what I'm cooking. I think ultimately, the question you need to ask yourself is this: do I need to know this information as soon as it's available? Do I crave it? Do I need to find out before anyone else? If the answer is yes, then there's probably thousands if not millions of people who feel exactly the same way, and that's where a live stream might be advantageous to your content.

Title: How to Get More YouTube Subscribers In ONE MINUTE!

How to Get More YouTube Subscribers In ONE MINUTE!
When you are logged into YouTube, you should see your channel logo in the top right-hand corner of most YouTube screens. If you click on that, you have the option to go to YouTube Studio. This is currently in beta, but will become a standard as 2019 progresses. This is your new dashboard or analytics homepage, and from here you want to click on the Settings section down the left-hand side.
On this screen click on Channel, and finally you want Branding. This is where you can set a video branding watermark, and what this does is add an image of your choice to the bottom right-hand corner of videos, which viewers can mouse over and use to subscribe to a channel. This branding watermark also appears on the mobile YouTube app, but you cannot use it here to subscribe to a channel. The ideal image should be square, 150 pixels by 150 pixels, and no more than one megabyte.
How to Add a Branding Watermark to Your YouTube Channel
To add a branding watermark, simply click Choose Image, and select one from your computer. You can select when the branding watermark appears on your videos, but we highly recommend choosing the entire video, so that the viewers have the opportunity to subscribe whenever they want. This branding watermark affects all videos on your channel, and don't forget to save before leaving this screen.

This is an absolute no-brainer, it's guaranteed to work, it's a free way to get more subscribers, and it's a YouTube tool. Now you could of course use your own channel logo, and many do, but my question is this. This is a branding watermark, and the call to action is to subscribe to your channel. So it might as well say exactly what it does on the tin. As you can see, when we changed our branding watermark to this current Subscribe button, and set it for the entire length of the video, our subscriber count from that source increased by over 500%, and because we're such lovely people, we want you to enjoy the same success.
This is the ‘Subscribe’ button mentioned in the video- just click on that link, download it, and apply it to your channel.

Title: 13 Ways to Grow Your YouTube Channel Right Now!

13 Ways to Grow Your YouTube Channel Right Now!
A huge number of YouTube creators find themselves at home right now, with perhaps a little more time on their hands as they get to avoid the morning commute, or have their lunchtimes to themselves. If you’re an active creator, you’ll know that most of your time is spent in front of the camera, and then editing the footage into something you’re eager to upload.
And while publishing consistent and engaging content is the key to growing views and subscribers, there are also many things you should be doing to keep your channel in the best possible shape. We’ve put together 13 little tasks you can easily do as part of this housekeeping. Just tackling one a day over the next couple of weeks can have a huge impact on your YouTube channel going forward. We’ll be suggesting the following:
13 Easy Ways to Grow Your YouTube Channel
Just devoting some time each day to the following can really improve the experience for your audience. Just pick one and start today!

#1 Fix Your YouTube Channel Page
Your channel page is the home of your YouTube universe that can often be forgotten and neglected once you start creating content. So it's time to revisit, fix, clean and improve it.
Make sure your channel trailer or the video that auto-plays at the top of the page best reflects what you do on your channel. If you don't have a channel trailer and you're not sure what video to use, pick the one that brings in the most subscribers. Viewers trust you with that content, after all, so you might as well use it.
Next up organize your video shelves so that they continue to educate visitors as quickly as possible as to what you do. For instance, on thevidIQ YouTube channel, we have a ‘New to vidIQ’ shelf that touches on our tools but also includes general YouTube tips and tricks, and gaming advice for creators since we know that content is incredibly valuable for a big portion of our audience.
Our next shelf is devoted to our latest uploads so visitors know that we are still creating content and on a very regular basis.
#2 Give Your YouTube Playlists Some Love
Many creators are great about keeping their playlists updated. But let’s be honest, you may have had really good intentions about keeping your playlists up to date, but have fallen a little behind.
Now's the time to package them all up nicely with neat little bows. Consider whether or not you need 98 videos in a playlist, because let's be honest, who's going to start watching a 98 video playlist. Just find a playlist that only has one or two videos in it and decide whether you're going to add more videos to it or get rid of the playlist.
Remember to write playlist titles as if they were video titles rather than file names. You've got to give a reason for viewers to click on those playlists too.
Read more advice oncreating playlists and why you should.
#3 Complete Your ‘About’ Section in Full
Reread and then rewrite your channel’ ‘About’ section. Focus as much as possible on the value the viewer will get from your channel. Make sure to drop in a few keywords to ensure your channel can be found by a user searching for those particular keywords.
Do this as a little test. See how many times you write the word you versus how many times you write I or talk about yourself. Remember, this isn't a dating profile. This is for your viewers, subscribers and community. Here’s the vidIQ about page to give you an example:
#4 Update Old Thumbnails and Video Titles
Now might be a great time to revisit some of your old videos with terrible thumbnails and see if you can make any improvements.
But bear in mind you do have to be a little strategic about this. There is an effort versus reward ratio, but you have to find the balance. Don't just go back to all of your old thumbnails and try to improve them.
Look at the videos you think are still relevant and they have performed well in the analytics, for instance forWatch Timeor maybe for audience retention. They may have done well for certain metrics, but they just haven't got the discoverability you think they deserve. For those videos, take a look at the thumbnails and try and improve on them them.
And the same goes for the titles as well. It's also highly likely that you've leveled up your metadata or search engine optimization skills. So take a look at the video descriptions, you can maybe have a look at the tags if you really want to. But again, be selective. Don't try and update everything, tests a couple of videos that you think have a potential to work now, even if you did make them six months, a year, five years ago.
Read more onbest practices for YouTube Custom Thumbnails.
#5 Fix Info Cards and End Screens
Also consider your info cards and end screens. You may have launched a video a year ago and it didn't do very well for a couple of months and then all of a sudden, it took off, and turned into evergreen content, which is a huge win!
But what you might have forgotten to do is go back to that video and say, hey, this video is getting a lot of views, maybe I could funnel those viewers into more recent content by using more appropriate info cards and end screens.
#6 Make Your Best YouTube Content Even Better!
Personally speaking I always think it's much more difficult to relight the fire in a existing video on YouTube. And I'm always more forward thinking in creating new content. So - create new content from your old content!
A couple of years ago, we made a video onhow to get 1,000 YouTube subscribersand it did pretty well 145,000 views. But since then the landscape has changed and I, personally speaking, feel I am a better educator and creator.
So we remade this video with new advice, better filmmaking techniques and improved SEO. And now thisnew video, published in February 2020, sits at the top of a search rankings with nearly 100,000 views in just a single month.
We did the same thing in the gaming topic, too. I made a video a while ago abouthow to start a gaming channel on YouTube, which now has over 800,000 views.
Then Dan, our gaming expert came along and he said, "I can do a better job than that." And I said, yeah, we'll go on then. And he did and it's at the top of the search rankings and will likely get a million views this year.
#7 Reach Out and Connect With Your YouTube Audience
So at the time of writing, we are still deep into theCoronavirus crisis, where there are many people stuck at home and they are turning to YouTube for entertainment, education, and in some cases, communication. This is where you as creators can step in.
Now I know that content takes a long time to create. For me it takes days, for others it takes weeks. For animators it can take months but there are ways you as a creator can create rapid fire content, and directly communicate with your audience every single day.
#8 Do a Livestream for Your Community
One of the best way to do this is through livestreams. If you've built up a community, you can invite all of those people who are stuck at home right now to join you in a livestream. I guarantee that your viewers will appreciate it.
We know this because we do channel audits every single week on thevidIQ YouTube channel(Tuesday 11am PT) and the engagement and enthusiasm is insane.
The aim isn't necessarily for you to gain Watch Time out of these streams, it's for you to give value to your viewers, whether it's through questions and answers, education, or just entertaining them.
There are a lot of people doing this right now, there are yoga instructors, musicians, fitness coaches who now can't go to their clients or go to their place of work and they're turning to YouTube to do that. If you're new to livestreaming, here's our brand new guide that's going to give you all the information you need:
#9 Use The YouTube Community Tab
If you have enough subscribers, as well as livestreams, you'll also have access to some other cool tools that allow you to keep in touch with your community on a regular basis.
The Community Tab is your YouTube social feed, and a place where you can post pictures, gifs and voting polls. You can tease video footage to go behind the scenes, or in our case celebrate our amazing 500,000 subscribers:
Voting polls in particular are a good source of engagement. Everyone loves to cast their ballot even if it is to decide the name of a vidIQ tool. There's also a cool extra bonus with community posts - they reach beyond your subscribers. If you want to know more about how that happens,watch this video. It is scary but fascinating at the same time.
#10 Use YouTube Stories
The next communication tool if you're fortunate enough to have it is YouTube Stories. YouTube Stories are essentially Instagram Stories or TikTok 15 second video clips that you record vertically. You don't create a thumbnail or a title, you simply push them to your YouTube channel, and people can watch them through via mobile YouTube app.
We've been using YouTube Stories to do Q&A. I'll post a clip asking if you've got any questions about your channel, vidIQ or YouTube just post them in the comments, and I will respond with a YouTube Story. They are proven to be very successful and they are generating a lot of subscribers for us as well.
Click here for a tutorial onhow to use YouTube Stories.
#11 Collaborate with Other Creators
Another way to communicate is to collaborate. Here I am making a cameo appearance on Dotto Tech to share my thoughts about working from home (catch me around 4:25 seconds in).
Steve Dotto and I helped run a YouTube meetup in Vancouver, so it felt like a natural fit to help him out. It also exposes me to a brand new audience of potentially 274K subscribers.
#12 Invest in yourself
Of course not everything needs to be directly associated with your YouTube channel. If you have the time, you can invest it in your personal development.
For example, you could learn how to use some new equipment such as a camera or a microphone to up your production values. You could go on to YouTube and find out how to better present in front of camera, to build your charisma.
You could, if you really want to, go through all of ourvidIQ videosand learn more about how to grow your YouTube channel. Or better yet, start one of ourAcademy courses! We have a 30 day, 32 video course about how to start your YouTube channel that's useful for even seasoned pros.
Right now economies across the globe are in total chaos. And as a result, people's lives and the way they work are going to fundamentally change. In this current landscape. YouTube provides many of these people with an opportunity, because there are almost no barriers to entry.
A lot of people have a lot of skills, and at the moment, they can't get paid for them. But what they can do is take those skills onto YouTube and create opportunities of their own.
If you haven't started your own YouTube channel yet, or you've already been on YouTube for a period of time and you're not doing anything right now. You may miss out. YouTube was already a competitive space coming into 2020 It isn’t going to get any less crowded anytime soon.
#13 Plan Out Future YouTube Content
Another thing you might want to do is create an ideas board. A lot of creators really do struggle with video ideas in the moment with the time that you have right now, you have the opportunity to build out six months, even potentially years worth of content.
If you do want to learn more about generating YouTube ideas, we have the perfect video here:

Title: No, It's NOT Too Late to Create a YouTube Gaming Channel (Zelda Case Study)

No, It's NOT Too Late to Create a YouTube Gaming Channel (Zelda Case Study)
We write a lot aboutgaming channelshere at vidIQ, as we’re always getting asked how to create a one, or how to grow one. We also get asked the following question a LOT - is it too late to start my own gaming channel when the competition is so fierce out in YouTube world.
And the answer is, if you hit the right strategy then no, it’s not too late. Particularly if you’re prepared to put in the work and the wait time. No-one is going to become as famous and successful asPewDiePieovernight (not even Pewds himself), but if gaming is your passion and you feel you have something of value to offer your target audience, then go for it. Today.
To show you it’s entirely possible, let’s shine a light on one particular creator who only started their channel in March 2020, and now (at time of writing) has over 8K subscribers.

100 Percent Zelda: A Gaming Channel Case Study
100 Percent Zeldais a channel focused on the action-adventure game Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and it came to vidIQ’s attention during one of our live-streamed channel audits that take place onYouTube every Tuesday.
The creator then shared a post on Twitter about how the channel was suddenly gaining some traction

To understand exactly what this creator thinks happened to get their channel to take off, we reached out to them and asked if they would share just a little bit of insight. What we learned from 100 Percent Zelda is, obviously, they're a fan of Zelda, but not only that, they're a fan of watching creators on YouTube who also play Zelda. Take a look at
How a YouTube Gaming Channel Got 1000 Subscribers in Three Months
The creator of 100 Percent Zelda decided they wanted to start a channel, so they started taking note of things they liked and things they didn't necessarily like about other creators and the way they were covering the game on YouTube.
In addition to doing some serious competitor research, they also joined Zelda communities across the Internet and paid really close attention to the types of questions people were asking in those communities.
Perhaps the most crucial step this channel took though was keeping their audience in mind when they decided to launch. They determined that if someone was going to subscribe for 100 Percent Zelda, they had better get 100% Zelda. But the creator went a step further and not only niched down on gaming and ‘Zelda,’ but went one step further to focus right in on ‘Zelda: Breath of the Wild.’
That’s proved to be a winning strategy, with videos like this one generating amazing views for a relatively small and new channel:
So, we already know that they've seen explosive growth covering ‘Breath of the Wild’, but the long-term plan for this channel is to eventually explore other Zelda games. As we know, there are plenty of Zelda games to choose from with more on the way in the future.
What’s really helping this channel with its success is the type of Zelda content they're creating. They're not just playing Zelda, they're answering those questions that they learned about from the community like ‘Which Rupee Farming The Best?’
Key to YouTube Success: Know Your Audience
The methods that 100 Percent Zelda used here to grow their own channel are totally repeatable. As with any big game franchise, when the game features a lot of depth like ‘Breath of the Wild’, a lot of questions come up as players try to find out how to do something in the game. That’s a lot of video content to be made just answering those questions.
100 Percent Zelda started their YouTube journey by making content specifically for their audience. As they continue to grow and people connect with them on a more personal level, that will be time to branch out into different Zelda games, or different games altogether.
Of course, if you want to play multiple games across multiple genres, then you'll probably start generating some subscribers, but any time you switch a game or switch a genre, you need to be prepared for some of those subscribers to never come back.
One size doesn't fit all on YouTube, but with a little research and some hard work, you can make high value, dependable content that people subscribe to and continue coming back for.

Title: The Secret to YouTube Success: Reply to More Comments!

The Secret to YouTube Success: Reply to More Comments!
On average, how many comments do you get on your YouTube channel every single day? As your channel grows, you’re only going to get more of them, so let me show you how to answer them efficiently so you can stay better connected with your audience.
YouTube has rolled out a new feature called ‘Smart Replies’ which should help you answer at least some comments with automated text. But we have an easier solution that you can use via thefree vidIQ tool.
New! YouTube Rolls Out Smart Replies
But first, let’s take a look at the new YouTube Smart Replies set up. You need to access the comments page first. To do this:

Underneath some of these comments, (but not all), you will see some smart reply boxes. To add these as a reply to the comment all you need to do is click the box which will populate the reply line, which you can edit if you wish before publishing.
When smart replies appear, you don't always get the same options as they are context-specific to the comment itself. Presumably, YouTube is picking out common phrases and predicting comments you might use as stock answers. Hopefully, over time this will improve, giving you more smart replies to more comments.
Reply to More YouTube Comments with vidIQ
Now while this is a step in the right direction for YouTube, I wouldn't exactly call them "smart" replies. First of all, they're fairly infrequent, and I would also say they're pretty dumb replies since each one only contains a few words and a smiley if you're lucky.
Well, there is a tool that can do this a lot better and it's absolutely free. Let me show you what it is.
Let's take this as an example. On a video about how to get 1,000 subscribers we see a person who has posted a comment, but they only have six subscribers. We know this because we havevidIQ installedand along with the sub count, you will see this vidIQ button:
If you click it, it opens up the ‘Comment Template’ tool where you can create stock answers to questions and comments you get that are specific to your channel.
So, in this case, we can reply with some videos that will help the creator get to a hundred subscribers before they even tackle a thousand subscribers. And we've done all of this in a matter of seconds.
Over the years, thevidIQ YouTube channelhas received over2 million comments. So we know we get asked all the time about Playlists and custom thumbnails and how to get4,000 hours of Watch Time- that's a big one.
But we also have a lot of ways to say thank you, which courtesy of the vidIQ's tool, also populates the commentor's name to personalize the response.
Our general recommendation is that you respond to every single comment on your channel but eventually, as your channel grows that’s going to become impossible.
But YouTube's Smart Replies, in combination with vidIQ's comment templates, all which, to remind you, is 100% free, at least gives you a fighting chance of responding to a lot more comments than typing out each one by hand.

Title: How to Test Which YouTube Videos Generate The Most Views

How to Test Which YouTube Videos Generate The Most Views
If you're really serious about YouTube and you want to grow your channel (and we know you are because you’re reading this post), then you should know that there’s a way of ‘testing’ your content to see what's actually working for you. It's a feature called 'YouTube Groups' and to access it:
This feature is a little hard to find, but it's going to allow you to test absolutely anything you want on your channel. Notes, these YouTube groups are not public, so viewers won't be able to see them as they do Playlists.
It's not going to interrupt their watching habits, but it does allow you to test the most minute changes on your videos to see what works so that you can double down on the best content on your channel. Check out our video tutorial about the feature:

How to Set Up a YouTube Group to Test Your Channel
OK, so now we know all about YouTube Groups, let's set one up. The first thing we need to do is to create a ‘Group.’ We're going to call this group ‘Thumbnails with Faces,’ and the feature allows us to search through our entire channel to add as many videos as we wish. Do note that you can search for videos by their ID, and the maximum number of videos in one single Group is 500.
In our example, we chose five videos that have a ‘face only’custom thumbnail, then we created another group of videos that had no faces in the thumbnail.
Once you set some Groups up, you can view all of the advanced analytics for them, which is really useful in itself. But we can take all of this one step further.
On the right-hand side of the screen, there is a compare to function which allows you to compare Groups. And that's exactly what we're going to do now - compare the group of videos with faces in thumbnails versus those without.
At a glance, we can see from this small sample size that video thumbnails that don't contain faces appear to perform better.
In the space of just 30 seconds of effort, we've learned something incredibly valuable about our channel. And that’s just one idea, how about these for ways of checking how your video content is performing? How about grouping videos by:
#1 Certain metadata, perhaps having something consistent in the title like ‘how-to’
#2 By video length, say five minutes. Do videos under five minutes work better than videos over five minutes? You'd be surprised at the potential answers to that, especially with educational content.
#3 If you still haven't nailed down at your channel niche or focus, then you could try grouping videos by topic or style. That might be beauty and travel, or it might be product reviews and vlogging. If you create a group of 10 videos of each of those topics, you'll get your answer from your audience pretty quickly as to what they prefer to watch on your channel. You could also group your videos by the month that they were published. So you may discover that all of the content that you create between April and July is a bit of a lean period for your channel. Whereas all of the content you make coming up to Christmas, say October to December, is your boom period.
Now once you've created these groups of videos, just be cautious of outliers. There may be a group of videos where one of the videos in that group is contributing more than 50% of the views or the impressions because it's just a viral video for you. You'll have to trim those out of your analysis.
Now we do have at one more thing to show you, and that is a cool way that vidIQ groups videos for you. The ‘Channel Audit’ tool quickly breaks down the success of your channel into specific groups, so if you want to know which videos gain your channel, the most subscribers, or which videos have the most engagement or the highest watch time, we can quickly tell you.
The ‘Channel Audit’ tool also shows you what you're doing wrong on your channel and things to fix such as missing end screens on videos. You can start using the tool for free, there's a download link below.

How to Get Your YouTube Subscribers to Watch Your Videos

What's more important to you as a YouTube creator - views or subscribers? Should you even have to choose? Well, for some creators, subscriber growth is steady and positive but the majority of those subscribers don't regularly return to watch their content. It's like they don't even care about the videos they publish!
In this week's episode of TubeTalk, I'm joined by vidIQ's very own Rob Wilson and Dan Carson to discuss why subscriber numbers don't always convert to higher views. It's a question we get asked a lot so we wanted to address it. In this podcast we cover:

Title: 7 Reasons Why Your YouTube Channel is Losing Views (And How To Fix It)

7 Reasons Why Your YouTube Channel is Losing Views (And How To Fix It)
For weeks, or even possibly months, your YouTube views and subscribers have been growing, and you’ve been happy with your content strategy. But all of a sudden, everything comes to a halt, and even though you may be creating and publishing more videos, you're getting fewer views on average. What is that about?
There may be a number of reasons which we’ll go over in this post. Or you can watch the video here:
#1 Global Lockdown - The Impact on YouTube views
Did your channel experience significant growth over the past few weeks? With global lockdown in place due toCOVID-19, many of us have been stuck indoors and glued to Netflix, Hulu, iPlayer, or YouTube because there has been nothing else to do.

But now the world is starting to reopen and which means less time is spent in front of our screens. And, of course, there's a little bit of viewer fatigue, because people can't watch Netflix and YouTube all of the time. Well, not everyone can.
For a lot of creators, you may be starting to see a slight decrease in your view counts. Want to know how that's impacted thevidIQ YouTube channel?
We were averaging around about 40,000 views per day at the start of March of 2020. Then, as the lockdown came into effect, a lot of people seized the opportunity to start their own YouTube channels and turned to us for advice. Consequently, we saw a massive upsurge in our view counts, going as high as100,000 views a day!
As lockdowns have been loosened in some countries, our view counts are starting to drop by 20%-25%. We’re sure other channels have seen the same fluctuations.
#2 Seasonal Changes Are Influencing Your YouTube Audience
The extraordinary events of the past few months and their impact on YouTube views and subscribers may be obvious for some channels. But for others, they see their view counts falling for unexplained reasons.
If you're doing all of the right things, and you're continuing to improve your content and your storytelling, YouTube will eventually reward you. Don't worry about the short-term hits that may be affecting your channel, because unfortunately, not all channels can be popular all of the time.
You can apply this to all sorts of YouTube channels. Take Food & Drink channels, for example. They can really come into their own around the holiday season, with Halloween,Thanksgiving, and Christmas to play with. But outside of these tentpole events, their views may drop.
The same applies to tech channels who push all sorts of products and gadgets in the run-up to Christmas. These channels can generate crazy views with unboxing and review content as consumers search for the neatest gift. But come the New Year everybody has spent their money, and they don't want to buy anything.
However, those same consumers may want to lose weight or stick to that New Year's resolution. That’s where educational channels can take advantage of the interest in diets, or work-outs or videos on how to stop smoking or cut down on drinking.
So this is where you as a creator need to think smarter, rather than work harder. That might be an opportunity for you to invest in some new equipment, or learn how to use a new editing software, or practice presenting in front of cameras. So you're doing things behind the scenes to improve so that when that audience picks up an interest again, you're ready to give them even better content.
#3 YouTube Policy Changes Can Change EVERYTHING
Another thing that can have a huge impact on your channel are policy changes from YouTube.
The most recent one of these, of course, was theFTC and COPPA ruling. YouTube were fined hundreds of millions of dollars and told to sort this mess out, and by sorting this mess out, passed on a lot of changes for many creators. For more info take a look at this video which explains everything you need to know about YouTube, COPPA, FTC and your Channel:
Under the new YouTube rules, If you make a video that is for a target audience of under the age of 13, you have to declare it. And when you do, that means people can't comment on that video, notifications don't go out to your subscribers for those videos, and you earn a lot less revenue because you can't use targeted ads on those videos.
YouTube is always tweaking their policies, especiallyCommunity Guidelines. Which, whether you realize this or not, will have an impact on how your videos are shared on YouTube, and how the algorithm treats your content.
So could have been making content in 2016 that was super popular with an audience. But things have changed in the YouTube landscape, which means the exact same content might not be shared as much as it used to be on the platform.
As a creator, you need to keep up to date about YouTube's policies and guidelines. Make sure you subscribe to theYouTube blog, and just check in with any guidelines that YouTube is sharing with you on a regular basis.
Twitter is a good place to go,@TeamYouTubeare always letting you know, as creators, what's changing in the YouTube landscape.
#4 The Impact of YouTube’s Many, Many, Many Algorithm Changes
YouTube is constantly changing, updating, or tweaking its algorithms to help the viewer find the content they want to watch.
When it comes to these changes, try to remember this: YouTube is not out to get you, the individual creator.
It is trying to create an environment where people stay on YouTube as long as possible, and they do that by serving up more of the content that viewers want to watch. There is no doubt that algorithm changes on YouTube will have a detrimental impact on some channels. But those same algorithm changes will have positive implications for many more YouTube channels.
Take this as an example. YouTube changes the algorithm, and it negatively affects 5% of the creator community. Chances are, especially on social media, you will hear a lot from that 5% that all of a sudden their views have gone down, and the algorithm is to blame.
And that's fair enough. But at the same time, let's say that algorithm change positively impacts 30% of the creator community. Do you think that 30% is going to praise YouTube about the algorithm change?
Do you think they're even going to hold the algorithm responsible for the growth in their channel? Are they going to assume that their content is just getting better, and more people are watching it? I'll let you decide on that one.
Algorithms are mysterious things, and as YouTube gives little to nothing away about their policies, a huge number of myths have grown around them. Find out thereal truth about YouTube algorithms here.
#5 Channel Fails Because the Creator Doesn’t Change Along with YouTube
Have you ever heard of the phrase doing something over and over again, and expecting something different to happen? Well, this is kind of the same logic.
You may have been doing the same thing over and over again, and being fairly successful. However, everything around you is changing, and you're slowly being left behind.
Maybe you had a channel that was really successful five or six ago but you took a long break from the platform. When you returned, you’re doing the same thing with your content, but the entire landscape has changed.
Let's just imagine your channel is happily going along, getting lots of views, doing really nicely. But then the topic is getting more competitive in your landscape, creators are trying new and different things, and all of a sudden, you're going to find yourself overtaken by everyone else.
So this is a warning to all of us: Don't get too comfortable. Always be learning, always be innovating, and testing new things.
#6 No-one is Interested in Your Content Anymore
We've already talked about seasonal changes and how they can impact a channel over the course of a year. But what if those seasonal changes are permanent?
For example, ‘Game of Thrones’ has been a cultural phenomenon over the last decade, and there are many channels on YouTube that have created content around the lore, the characters, and the cast.
But ‘Game of Thrones’ has finished now, and general audience interest in the series is probably beginning to wane. There are always going to be hardcore fans, but the general public is probably moving on to something else now.
So if you continue to create ‘Game of Thrones’ content around the TV series, do you think you're going to continue to sustain your channel? Probably not.
This is a problem that affects many gaming channels too. They get really popular with a certain type of game but they're not sure where to go next. What do they do? That's where you, as a creator, have to prepare for those changes.
You have to tap into an audience's enjoyment of "Game of Thrones" and try to determine what they are going to like next. Don't be afraid to always be thinking about what you can test next. Whether that be the next TV series or game that you want to cover. If you’re a gaming channel that’s struggling, take a look at this video for advice:
#7 You're Not Aligning Yourself With YouTube's Goals
Two billion people watch YouTube every single month. So there's still another six billion people YouTube want to tap into with their platform.
They're not standing still, and they're going to continue to evolve their platform. That means they will test many different things, and they will tweak their algorithms every single day.
We've been hearing more and more about something that seems almost impossible to quantify,Quality Watch Time. This isn't a metric that's available in YouTube's studio (yet) but it’s vital to know about.
As a platform, YouTube wants to serve up the type of content that you, as a viewer, want to watch and to continue watching that content. if a viewer is satisfied with what they're watching every time they come onto YouTube, they'll continue to use the service.
We have to accept that, as video creators, each one of us represents a tiny water droplet in the ocean of this video-watching platform. And when YouTube drops something into that ocean it creates a huge ripple effect, and it's up to us to ride those waves in a positive fashion.

Title: YouTube’s Community Tab: Winning Strategies for Promoting Your Videos

YouTube’s Community Tab: Winning Strategies for Promoting Your Videos
How did you promote your YouTube videos? Did you know there’s a tool that you probably never even used for this? Did you know you can drive views to an unlisted YouTube video just by promoting it with a direct link?
One way to do that is through the YouTube Community Tab.
Now, I am fully aware that not all of you will have access to the Community Tab right now. To do so, you’ll need 1000 YouTube subscribers, but we've got a video on how you can get to that numberright here.

If you have the ability to access the Community Tab, you’ll know that it actually has a built-in function for selecting any video on YouTube, including your own, as well as unlisted videos to promote to your community. Of course, you can use it to post any message you like:
Now, the really cool thing about the Community Tab is that these posts don't just reach your subscribers, they can reach anybody on YouTube who may be interested in your content.
We've actually already done a really interesting video about this when lots of people were getting really annoyed because they were seeing lots of Pewdiepie versus T series posts on our Community Tab. You can watch that here:
How to Use YouTube’s Community Tab the Right Way
Having just told you to use the Community Tab to promote a video, I have a sneaky suspicion that YouTube may suppress reach for that type of content. And this is my investigation into whether or not that is true.
YouTube doesn't provide any data for views or impressions for a community post, but you can judge performance via engagement.
For vidIQ, we find that, on average, community posts will get 500 or so likes and at least 100 comments. However, every time we publish a community post using the YouTube video link tool, we'll get just 15% of the engagement we usually would do. 🤔
So, here's what I decided to do. Instead of posting a video on the Community Tab, the way YouTube wants me to do it, I used an alternative strategy. And this is what I found out.
So, first of all we did a control test. This community posts use the conventional-video link style, YouTube offers. The video was unlisted at the time so I knew that most, if not all of the views coming into this video were from this community post promotion only.
The results were 288 views over a 48 hour period. The traffic sources confirmed that most of these views came from channel pages, which is where community posts and video links fall under.
Now for my next test - again, with an unlisted video, I shared the link to the video directly in the community post and offered people the chance to rate the video for a voting poll.
In the same period, around 48 hours, this community post got nearly four times as many likes. So, a lot more engagement already. The voting poll style post also had more video views than the conventional-video link community post.
Clearly, more people love voting poll posts than the dedicated video link posts, and as a result, more people watched the video from the voting poll post.
What I also learned is that, people just like voting on stuff even if they don't read instructions. Look! I told people to watch a video and give it a star rating. At the time of recording the video above, 650 people did watch the video, but 1400 people gave it a rating. Figure that one out!
I wanted you to do one more test using a different community post strategy. It was an unlisted video with a video link added directly into the community post. But this time I used an image instead of a voting poll -and the video really took off.
In its first 48 hours, it got 1700 views. We left it unlisted for a week and it still got 3000 views from that one community post.
Winning Strategies for Promotion With YouTube’s Community Tab
Let's summarize everything.
First of all, if you have access to the Community Tab on YouTube, you should be using it to promote your video. However, what you shouldn't do is promote your videos using YouTube conventional-video sharing link, because it seems to suppress those posts and nobody watches the videos.
What you should do is think of inventive ways to make your community feel valued and part of the process. That's why I teased our community posts with exclusive access, and it's why I set up a voting poll to get people to interact with the post itself.
However, you also need to consider this. In order to get some raw numbers, I had to post a list of videos in the Community Tab. And what I may have done is damaged the potential of those videos when they go live to the public.
For example, those 3,000 views from that unlisted video I posted in the community didn’t send YouTube any positive signals in terms of click-through rates and impressions.
When I launched that video, some of our community has already seen it, so they were less likely to watch it again.
So, use these Community Tab strategies to promote content that's already published on your channel. Whether it's a video you posted a few days ago, and you want to remind people through the Community Tab that you have new content, or you go into your back catalog and find videos that were popular six months ago and reintroduce them to a brand new audience on your channel.

Title: How to Find Out the Best Time to Publish a Video on YouTube

How to Find Out the Best Time to Publish a Video on YouTube
How do you get more views on your YouTube videos? Well, you publish them at the right time for your audience and it just so happens that both YouTube and VidIQ have tools that can help you with that.
First, let’s start with the new YouTube feature that will let you know the best times to publish your video content. To access this tool:
On this dashboard, you'll see a new module labeled ‘When Your Viewers are on YouTube’. Now, to be clear, this isn't specifically about your viewers watching just your content. It's when viewers who watch your content are on YouTube watching any video.

Think of it like this. There may be somebody at home, sat on a sofa, watching Friends because they're a huge fan of sitcoms. Chances are, they're probably going to also enjoy The Big Bang Theory, so programming logic suggests that The Big Bang Theory should come on straight after Friends.
If you know when your audience is on YouTube you can schedule your videos to be published at that time.
In this visual representation, the deeper the color shade, the higher volume of viewers there are. For example, many of our viewers are on YouTube at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time Wednesday mornings while fewer viewers are online at 8:00 p.m. on a Friday evening.
Best Time to Publish to YouTube: Exclusive vidIQ Data
That’s YouTube's new ‘best time to post’ feature, but we’ve had very similar data in thevidIQ toolfor years.
To access it, click on ‘Videos’ in the left-hand navigation bar in YouTube Studio. Next, click on the ‘edit’ details page for any video (the little pencil symbol). Scroll down a little, and on the right-hand side of this new screen, you will see this ‘Best Time to Post’ tool from vidIQ.
This tool will show you when your audience is most active on YouTube, giving you three-hour windows for when you may want to publish your content. You can click through all the days of the week and see an overall weekly view too, like the one above.
vidIQ is able to provide this data by analyzing your subscriber activity. To see this in action, just click the VidIQ extension button in your browser to activate the drop-down menu, then click on ‘Subscriber Insights.’
The link will take you to a brand new dashboard. It will show you the other channels your subscribers are subscribing to, and which videos they really enjoy watching. Since we know subscribers tend to watch your content for longer, this can be a more reliable data source, albeit from a smaller sample size.
The logic is fairly straightforward. You set up your hotdog stand at lunchtime outside the office because people are hungry. You don't go there at 3:00 a.m. in the morning because there's gonna be no one there to buy your hotdogs. When you know there are more people online who enjoy your content, that's when you should publish it with a few little things to consider:
Firstly, YouTube state themselves that the publish time is not known to directly affect the long-term performance of videos and this can certainly be true of search-based content that needs time to establish itself before momentum really starts to kick in. I wouldn't be surprised if this very video follows a similar trajectory.
Secondly, depending on the content, sometimes YouTube and your audience are not going to wait for your best time to post. For example, if Apple announced their latest iPhone or Marvel released a trailer for their latest Avenger movie at 4:00 p.m. on a Monday, are you going to wait until 7:00 a.m. the following day to add your voice to the conversation? Chances are, the YouTube audience has already got its fill from an alternative source by then.
Also, consider exactly when you publish your video because you might want to miss the on-the-hour and half-hour peak times. At the top and bottom of every hour, loads of creators publish their videos and loads of notifications get sent out to subscribers. Do you want to compete with these or publish your content a few minutes before or after these peak spikes of traffic?
Also, treat your videos a little like stocks. You don't want to invest when their value is at its peak because there's only one direction that can go. You want to get involved when the velocity is starting to ramp up. So if your potential audience's peak time on YouTube is noon then maybe you want to publish your video at 9, 10, or 11:00 a.m.
Finally, when you upload your video to YouTube, remember that it takes time to prepare it and process it. You've got titles, descriptions, tags, thumbnails, end cards, info cards, all of that stuff to consider, and if it's a 4K video, you want it to look the best it can do when people first watch it. So give yourself one or two hours before you actually unleash it on your audience.

Title: 4 Awesome Lessons Every YouTube Creator Can Learn from Joe Wicks

4 Awesome Lessons Every YouTube Creator Can Learn from Joe Wicks
British exercise coach and rising YouTube superstar Joe Wicks has somehow made homeschooling interesting and simultaneously saved many parents from insanity during the current pandemic.
In the process, he’s added more than 1.5 million followers to his YouTube channel since March 2020. At time of writing he now has 2.4M subscribers, and just under 170M YouTube views.
As a nutrition and fitness coach known as theBody Coach, Wicks saw an opportunity to reach a new audience amid the coronavirus pandemic.

He's built on his existing business by launching his hugely successful online physical education classes, “P.E. With Joe”. These live-streamed classes are aimed at kids of varying ages while they’re social distancing at home.
His first 'PE with Joe: 9am Workout' was uploaded to YouTube on the 23rd of March 2020, and has generated a staggering 6.7M views to date.
So whether you’re just starting out on YouTube, or you’re a seasoned creator looking to increase your number of followers, here are four takeaways you can learn from Joe Wicks.
#1 Be Flexible with Your Video Content
No, you don’t need to be able to do 50 squats, followed by 30 seconds of high knees, and then 20 star jumps.
But you do need to be flexible to change. Wicks saw a window of opportunity in society’s current lockdown and adapted accordingly to increase the content he offers. This has seen him increase his followers across all platforms.
#2 Diversify Your Audience
By being flexible, Wicks has been able to diversify his target audience to now include children.
Now, he’s not selling his products to children. His “P.E. With Joe” classes are free. But his sessions have become so popular that many parents confess to getting involved in them. It’s the parents who are potential customers for Wicks’ other products, which are based on healthy eating and fitness.
So don’t be afraid to expand your content a little to attract new audiences and potentially increase your revenue.
#3 Dive into Live Streaming
Never underestimate the power of a live stream.
This content marketing method takes much less time and money to put together, with no editing required (Wicks’ toddler daughter has even been spotted invading his classes on occasion).
It makes your audience feel like they get to know you a bit better. They get to see the unedited version of you, and that can help build the level of trust the audience feels for your brand.
Also, by directing your content to a targeted audience who are already interested in what you have to say, you have a better chance of conversions.
#4 Make Your Videos Personal
In addition to inviting people virtually into his home in real time, Wicks makes his sessions personal.
Given the popularity of his classes with young viewers, he’s been doing shout-outs and reading messages from fans during his lessons to create engagement.
By adding this personal element, Wicks creates a bond with his audience while simultaneously encouraging them to keep consuming his content and engaging with him.
So if you’re a creator looking for ways to increase your followers and take advantage of the fact a large part of the world’s population is stuck inside for the foreseeable future, try to incorporate these four aspects when creating your content.
Now, if you don’t mind, I have 20 push-ups and 10 squat lunges to do.

Or use that content to drive traffic to another property, such as a website.

Title: How to Live Stream on YouTube with Streamlabs OBS - Beginner's Setup Guide

How to Live Stream on YouTube with Streamlabs OBS - Beginner's Setup Guide
Going live on YouTube these days isn't as complicated as you would think. In this post, we'll discuss a few different things you need to know to make your live stream as professional as possible including:
I’m a gamer so I like to give things a gaming focus, so I am going to be using video game live streaming as an example. But all of the following advice will apply to any type of YouTube channel looking to learn how to broadcast live.
How to Live Stream on YouTube: The Hardware You’ll Need
Streaming these days is a lot easier when it comes to the hardware you're going to need. I'll show you what I use to stream from my own computer when I play games, and hopefully, that will give you a good baseline for a guide.

First off, let’s talk about the Internet. This is going to be the biggest bottleneck you're going to face while live streaming. The Internet is such an important element in the mix because, in some areas of the world, you just can't control what kind of speed you're going to get when you sign up for your Internet plan.
The best speed I can recommend is no less than five megabits per second upload when you're trying to stream on YouTube. Personally, I have 10 megabits per second for my upload speed, and it allows me to push a better quality live stream. 5 is just my personal recommendation because I think any less, and you're going to struggle when it comes to quality.
Now for the type of computer you need to play a game, and live stream it at the same time, I have a GTX 1060, three gigabytes, with 16 gigabytes of RAM. I’m also using an older AMD Ryzen 7 processor. These items allow me to stream with 10 megabits per second upload. I can play Minecraft at 1080p with 30 frames a second, or I can play it at 720p with 60 frames a second.
If I try to push it any higher than that, the game performance and stream quality drops. The bottom line is that top-quality hardware is great, but with software advancing so much, not using the very latest state-of-the-art computer doesn't have to limit you.
Software: Encoding a Live Stream Broadcast on YouTube
When we talk about software for live streaming, we're actually talking about encoders. Anything you've used to live stream is an encoder, but I’m going to focus onStreamlabs OBSfor this tutorial.
There are a lot of encoders out there,YouTube actually has a list of recommendations, some free, some not. Thanks to how powerful these encoders have become, using something like Streamlabs OBS allows you to stream a game on your computer at a much higher quality than ever before.
Before we dive in head first, I will warn you this set-up can get very technical, and I'm going to cover it very briefly, in the most basic way possible, just to get you started. All the things I'm showing you are going to depend on you at the end of the day. You need to run test streams on your own channel, and maybe even get feedback from viewers on different testing streams you try.
Let’s go through the Streamlabs OBS set up.First, you’ll need to connect to your YouTube channel by logging in - just follow all the prompts!
Now let's tackle some of the more technical aspects of live streaming on Streamlabs OBS. If we visit the output section, we can choose our encoder. In the example I use in the video (above), it's set to software x264. This is going to use my CPU to do all of my encoding for me, but if you want, you can change it to NVENC or the new version of that.
This uses your graphics card to encode. Depending on what you're doing, the game you're playing, or the type of broadcast you're doing.
Personally, I prefer using NVENC when I'm streaming, so I'm going to go ahead and select that. And I'm going to do a bit rate of about 5,000 because I already know my system, and I know it can handle that. Like I said before, this is going to take testing on your part, so maybe 2,500 is a good place for you to start, and you can go from there.
Now on to the video tab. You'll notice the base canvas resolution is 1920 x 1080. I would leave it at that. In theory, I should probably raise the base canvas resolution, but that's okay. I just got my 4K monitor, and I don't feel like resizing all of the different elements that I have on my normal live stream, so I'm going to leave it at 1080.
But the output scale is what's going to directly impact your broadcast, and I'm broadcasting at 720. These days, when people watch live streams, they watch them on a variety of devices, including phones and laptops. So with this screen being a little more compact, and squashed down to 720, it is probably going to give you a higher quality live stream at little to no impact on the viewer.
If you lower that resolution, it's going to get you closer to being able to stream at 60 frames a second, which will impact everybody who's watching, regardless if it's a nice, big TV or a phone. So because I like high frame rates when I'm playing games, I'm going to leave it at 720, but if you have a super awesome computer, maybe you can try 1080 at 60 frames. That's all up to you.
The last recommended setting is under ‘Advanced’. You can scroll down and find “dynamically change bitrate when dropping frames while streaming”.
A dropped frame is basically when the stream can't keep up and starts skipping frames. You may have a nice 60 frame stream going, but now, those frames are being dropped little by little. If the software detects that, it will change your bitrate to keep up.
So this might take some of the sharpness away from the image, but the frame rate will stay high, which is what you want. To save your changes, go ahead and click ‘Done.'
Posting Your Live Stream to YouTube
Now you’re almost ready to click ‘Go Live’, but there's one more thing we need to do, and that's set it up on the YouTube end.
Setting up a live broadcast is a lot like setting up a regular video. You still need an engaging title, a great description, some keyword tags, and a powerfulcustom thumbnail.
Head over to the YouTube Studio, click on ‘Create’, then in the drop-down menu hit ‘Go Live.’ If you've streamed before, you're going to get a prompt that tells you that you can copy all the settings, the thumbnail, the description, etc. from a previous stream, or you can go ahead and set up a new stream.
In my example, I’ve clicked on the ‘New Stream’ option so now I'm going to set up everything I need for the live stream, like the title and description.
You can also set your live stream to private, public, or unlisted, just like a normal video. If you want to make it private for a little while so you can tweak the description and other metadata, go ahead and do that. But if you want people to know that you're going to stream at some point, go ahead and make it public.
Now add a description, then add a title for your game, that's really important to help YouTube categorize you for that game.
Further down the Streamlabs OBS dashboard, there is an option to schedule for later. I would highly recommend doing this, as a live stream is an event, and you want people to know when it's going to happen. Scheduling for later will allow you to set the date and the time that you're going to go live, and everyone will know exactly when to come to your stream!
Next is the ability to upload your very own YouTube custom thumbnail. Having a great thumbnail is always crazy important, no matter whether it’s a video you’ve uploaded, or whether it’s a live stream. You want that thumbnail to be clickable because it’s an invitation to watch your content. If a viewer is intrigued, they will click through to your video.
Next on the dashboard is where you tell YouTube whether this live stream is ‘Made for Kids’ or not. You also have the option to impose restrictions on viewers because of their age. If you choose to restrict it to viewers that are 18 or over, YouTube users will get a notice that this live stream may not be appropriate for younger viewers.
If you’re happy with your title, description and custom thumbnail, and have completed all the details YouTube needs you to then you are ready to hit ‘Create Stream.’
Once you've created the stream, a new dashboard pops up while you're broadcasting live. It shows you all kinds of data, but what you really need to pay attention to is the information in the bottom left of the Streamlabs dashboard which is all about stream latency.
Basically, normal latency takes the broadcast and renders it for the audience. They're going to get a higher quality broadcast, but they're also going to see a higher delay based on when their chat message goes out and the time you read it. Viewers may pick up on that.
Choosing low-latency or ultra low-latency will cut down on that buffering time, but you risk your stream being lower quality.
Because you've already logged into YouTube on Streamlabs, you shouldn't need to worry about this, but if you're using a different encoder, and not Streamlabs OBS, you will need to grab the stream key and paste it into your encoder on Streamlabs. (Of course, sharing your stream key will allow people to take over your channel and stream whatever they want on it, and you don't want that!)
After you’ve finished streaming, you can come back to the Streamlabs dashboard and check out the analytics, your viewer activity, and your stream health. You can basically check all the data insights that would you after uploading any video.
Stay tuned for more expert tips on live streaming on YouTube!

Title: How One Tiny YouTube Channel Generated 1000 Subscribers & 4000 Watch Time Hours in 24 HOURS!

How One Tiny YouTube Channel Generated 1000 Subscribers & 4000 Watch Time Hours in 24 HOURS!
How do you effectivelymonetize your YouTube channelin just 24 hours? Well, it's pretty simple actually. You pick the richest company in the world and you exploit the biggest tech search blind spot I have ever seen. I love case-studies like this!
But first, let's start with a little story.
Weirdly, I discovered this teeny YouTube channel, whose views had completely blown up literally overnight, because of my yearning for the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook. I'm one of the few people in the world who gets Chromebooks. I love the fact that they're super light-weight, and even after years of use they never really slow down.

So when Samsung announced the Rolls-Royce of all Chromebooks, with a 4K AMOLED display with a stylus, I was all, "shut up and take my money". Even though it costs an eye-watering $999 USD, and it isn’t even available to buy in Canada (where I’m based).
So, if I can’t get my hands on the new Chromebook, what are the alternatives? I started to search around.....
Now, I was always under the impression that iPads were tablets. These days, however, Apple seems to be touting them as a viable alternative to the traditional computer. But I always thought computers needed a keyboard and at the very least, a track-pad, to give them the productivity you need.
And apparently, Apple now has an answer: theiPad Pro Magic Keyboard, a first-party accessory that attaches itself directly to the tablet.
Despite the price tag of $299 USD, it did capture my attention. But I needed to do the research here. I'm not just going to jump straight into this. But if I am going to do the research, I'm going to do what everybody else does - I'm going to search for it on YouTube.
YouTube Search: The iPad Magic Keyboard
Now, being a tech enthusiast, I assume that when I search for a product such as the “iPad Pro Magic Keyboard”, the usual creator suspects are going to appear: MKBHD, Unbox Therapy, Linus Tech Tips, and so on.
And when I searched for “iPad Pro Magic Keyboard” on YouTube, the auto-suggestion list was full of all of the keywords and phrases you might expect. So far so good.
But on April 19th 2020, that same search didn't return any videos about thw iPad Pro Magic Keyboard from any major tech creator. Not one. And I thought that was pretty odd.
I even checked on the Apple website just to confirm the keyboard was actually out. And it was, although there is a lengthy shipping delay. But on that particular date, I didn’t see any content in the YouTube search results from the creators I know, love, and most importantly, trust.
So let's go back to the YouTube to see what resultswerebeing returned to me, the viewer.
First of all, from a VidIQ perspective, we think ‘iPad Pro Magic Keyboard’ is a fairly juicy keyword. Our keyword tool (which you can access bydownloading our free extension) confirms that search volume interest is increasing, and there’s not enough video competition to keep up with demand. That’s a win for any creator right there.
No matter which way you slice and dice it, the launch of any Apple product is a massive global event. Which means it is always a BIG thing in the tech community.
On April 19th, YouTube pushed one creator in particular to viewers searching for ‘iPad Pro Magic Keyboard’. Up until that date,MrExitStrategyonly had 1.2K subscribers, and was just one of the millions and millions of channels posting random content. The creator didn’t even appear to have any strategy around optimization or a growth, as witnessed in the poor quality of titles, descriptions, and thumbnails.
Then, out of the blue, this TikTok-length video appears on their channel - and hey, it’s all about that Magic Keyboard that every Apple iPad owner is starting to get really, really excited about.
You can see from the VidIQ Historical View Count feature, how the video quickly gained massive traction.
So how did a 19-second video from a tiny YouTube channel generate 75,00 views in twenty-four hours? And how did that creator's videos jump to the top of the search rankings for a very juicy Apple tech phrase?
I think it's pretty simple - the absence of options. I think for a brief moment of time, that video was one of the, if not,thefirst videos to offer a genuine review of the Apple Magic Keyboard. And with that golden opportunity, the creator did what we always recommend you do, double down on your best content.
YouTube Success: Quantity Over Quality?
There is a well-worn debate that often rages amongst YouTube creators - quantity versus quality. Most will rightly argue that quality should take precedence. But this is a perfect example where I would argue the exact opposite. At least to a certain degree.
When you have everyone's attention, because there is no competition, you should push out as much content as possible because that window of opportunity is not going to last long.
So yes, six videos from MrExitStrategy's small channel in a 48 hour period may seem a little excessive, but when you do a search for that 'iPad Pro Magic Keyboard' and all of the results at the top of the search engine are from the same creator, whose videos are you going to click on?
The videos themselves tell me two things. First of all, this creator really does like his computers. And secondly, sometimes all you need is a mobile phone and something interesting to film. I think, basically, in this situation this creator has two objectives for serving their audience:
At the time of writing, MrExitStrategy’s YouTube channel has now generated972K views, which will undoubtedly get him to4,000 hours of Watch Time. Of course, he has over the required 1000 subscribers too so he’s now eligible toapply for the YouTube Partner Program.
It is a little concerning that a channel with that many views only has a tiny amount of subscribers. But this is a feature of many, many tech and educational channels.
Why?
Well, often viewers just their specific questions answered, they don't want or need to subscribe to the channel after that. And to be honest, the quality of the videos on MrExitStrategy’s channel does suggest that the creator isn’t using any kind of strategy to encourage viewers to subscribe for future content.
So you might see this as a smash and grab. The opportunity was there and the creator grasped it with both hands. So what's going to happen to those search results when all of the other tech creators get their hands on this product?
How Smaller Tech Channels Can Win at YouTube
On April 20th 2020, I did an incognito search for ‘iPad Pro Magic Keyboard’, so that my watch and search history wouldn't influence any results.
And I witnessed a brand new set of well-established super popular creators, such as The Verge,iJustine, and Peter McKinnon, top the search rankings.
To find our hero of this particular case study, I had to scroll way down the list. When you no longer have something unique to present to the audience, quality is always going to win out.
What's very interesting about all of these new videos I saw flood in was when they were published. All at exactly the same time. 9AM EST on April 20th 2020.
The reason for this is, of course, major tech companies will send out new products to the most trusted creators and ask them not to publish their reviews or unboxing videos until a certain date and time.
So all of these big creators, like The Verge (video below), were waiting for that release embargo date to arrive.
But those rules don’t apply to your average consumer who orders a product from a website and just happens to get it before the release embargo. And again, that probably comes down to the unique challenges that thecoronavirusis presenting to tech firms right now when it comes to logistics.
Some people just receive their products early, then immediately post about them to YouTube. All of which has created the perfect storm for this particular YouTube case study.

How to Get More Subscribers On YouTube in 15 Seconds!
We at vidIQ have been creating YouTube Stories alongside the regular content we uploadto our channel, and you have been loving them. And you’ve been loving Stories from other creators too.
Now, YouTube has added a brand new call-to-action button to its YouTube Stories feature which allows viewers to subscribe directly to the channel that published that content. That’s fantastic news for creators who want to boost their subscriber count.
YouTube Stories: Boosting Subscribers & Your Community
YouTube Stories are very similar tocommunity postsin that they work best on mobile devices, and are an amazing way of keeping in touch with your audience when you're not creating longer content. Most of us take a couple of days, even weeks, to push out new videos, but with these bite-size pieces of content, you can stay in touch with your audience every single day.

WithYouTube Stories, the maximum video length is 15 seconds. __15 seconds for a subscriber? I think that sounds worth it, don't you? __
Built into this new feature is one massive plus and one huge negative. We'll start with the negative first. Unfortunately for many of you, this feature is not going to be available right unless you have 10,000 subscribers. But as with all YouTube features, Stories will be rolling out to more and more creators in the future, so do make sure to check on your mobile device to see if you have access.
On the flip side, here's a really interesting thing about that Stories subscribe button I don't think YouTube has considered.
When you're not subscribed to a channel and you watch one of their Stories, you’ll see a subscribe button which allows you to, well, subscribe. Right up until that Story finishes you still have the ability to unsubscribe using the same button.
However, once you're subscribed to a channel and you watch more Stories, there is no unsubscribe button. I don't know whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, but ultimately you've got nothing to lose in pushing people to subscribe to your channel, right?
Tracking the Success of YouTube Stories in Analytics
And in more good news, you can actually track the success of your YouTube Stories in analytics. Just click on the ‘See More’ button on ‘Channel Analytics’ in YouTube Studio, then click on ‘Subscription Sources.’ YouTube Stories will be one of those sources and you can click the checkbox filter to see subscribers by YouTube stories only over the last 28 days.
Now, I am not for a second advocating that you should adopt a ‘subscribe to me’ mentality when it comes to YouTube Stories. What I am suggesting you do, as with all of your content, is provide value.
We've been experimenting with a YouTube story Q and A where people can ask us any question they like and I will respond with a YouTube story. We get tons of engagement, and whenever we run one of these mini YouTube clinics, we see a mini-surge in subscribers from YouTube stories.
Now, these are not channel-changing numbers, but I see this as another tool in your YouTube arsenal for growing your audience. Every subscriber helps.

3 Laws of YouTube: Full Transcript
Liron Segev: Sean, thank you for being here on TubeTalk
Sean Cannell:	Man, after that introduction, I don't even know who you're talking about. I'm tired after that introduction. That sounds exhausting.
Liron Segev:	I do not know how you do it, and on top of which, you have an event that you run. Sean, what's got you ridiculously excited about this YouTube world that you're in?
Sean Cannell:	You know, I don't think my excitement for YouTube has changed ever since I first discovered its power and its potential. I am empathetic to the fact that there's demonetization and whole channels dealing with, whether it's copyright issues or the community guidelines shifting, but all that to say, I think it's important we never forget that YouTube is a free platform that I know I didn't create the internet, I didn't create YouTube, and yet, it's changed so many of our lives. It's changed my life and people listening right now. I just have immense gratitude.
I know Susan (Wojcicki) didn't start the company, but if I ever see her, I want to hug her and give her flowers as well as the whole team because YouTube is just this amazing place. It's not problem-free, but it has so much potential, and that potential still exists at such a major level right now.
Liron Segev:	Let's rewind the clock a little. Tell me about the time you decided that look, YouTube is for you. What happened? What were you doing at the time when you saw this amazing potential?
Sean Cannell:	Well, I'll go just a few clicks before that. That was when I got into video. I started video in 2003 just because I was volunteering at my local youth group in my small town, Marysville, Washington, an hour north of Seattle. I picked up a video camera and Adobe Premiere and I started making these weekly video announcements. They were terrible. We always say your first videos are your worst videos. I know every creator can relate to that, but think about what a blessing it was that I was actually putting out these videos that were playing Wednesday night at youth group, and they weren't even posted online yet. I was cutting my teeth. I was getting through that season of suck. I sometimes say, as I walk through the season of suck, I will fear no evil because you kind of go through the season of suck.
I got started in video, and then fast-forward a couple of years, the first YouTube channel I actually worked on was my church's. Now, this is actually shocking because churches are usually years behind, sometimes a decade behind, but yet, for whatever reason, in our small town, our pastor was pretty progressive. Twitter came out, YouTube came out in 2005, but he wanted to start a channel. So in 2007, I'm uploading videos. There's 15-minutes time limits, so we're turning everything into two and three-parts and trying to figure out thumbnails and titles and all that stuff. I didn't know anything, but think about how early that was.
So by 2009, I started a business called Clear Vision Media, and started helping businesses build websites. I did video production for them. Started working with authors and speakers. In fact, that's when I met Benji Travis, the co-author of YouTube Secrets, at the YMCA in our small town. We started to connect. He said, "Hey, my wife's this famous ..." Famous? He's like, "My wife's got like 150,000 YouTube subscribers." I was like, "You're a liar." I didn't say that, but I'm thinking it. Not in our small town. What are you saying, bro? But then I went home. I was like, "What the heck?"
Early on, we actually worked together. I was a videographer for them and doing video production way back in 2009, 2010. That's how I kind of got into YouTube. All the way in 2007, once I started watching some of the early YouTubers, Julian Smith ... Come on, remember the Malk video? Some of that stuff. Early guys. I was so excited about the platform. I didn't know what I was going to do or what the future held specifically; I just knew, man, I see something happening here. I am passionate about it. This seems so powerful.
And now years later, that has come true. That's not just financial or business. I mean, friendships, relationships. Our relationship, us being at events together.
Liron Segev:	And it's international. Go to sleep at night here in the States, and wake up in the morning, and there's 100 comments on your videos from people who've just woken up on the other side of the globe, loving your content, want to engage with you, felt the need to leave a comment on your video. Are you finding that today people starting out have it much easier or is it maybe just very different today to when you got started?
Sean Cannell:	My answer here is kind of unique. I think it's equal and here's why: I think that, for me of course, I had the early adopter advantage because I got into YouTube years ago, but I also had a lot of disadvantages. There wasn't channels like Video Influencers or Think Media, so we were completely just trying to figure it out - testing, experimenting, wandering through the desert, making mistakes, trying to figure it all out.
And on top of that, even the technology was significantly harder. Now we're talking dual pixel auto focus, tap your face, all these things that are so much ... I mean, people trip these days. They're like, "I can't believe the camera doesn't have IBIS. I can't believe it doesn't even have auto-focus." I'm like, "Bro, that's new. Those things are just a few years old." We had to manually focus our cameras and guess what? Just take the extra time to do it.
I think that it's equal because while being an early adopter is easy with less competition or easier, there's still so much to learn. Now you flip it, you can learn faster, you can skip whole skillsets. Editing is speeding up. Even the production, renders, exports, all of that's speeding up. You've got better information, you've got proven roadmaps from people that have gone there and can help you get there further faster, but you do have increased competition. Of course, every day competition is more increasing.
I think it comes down to this: it doesn't matter. Is it too late? Can I still break through? Is the weather perfect right now? It just never will be perfect.
Liron Segev:	People just need to do it because so many people who are stuck in this cycle of research, analysis paralysis. I'm going to watch another video. I'm going to take another course. I'm going to download another PDF. The best way to do it is to do it. You want to share a message? Just share the message. Simple as that. Do you find some common denominators amongst all the people that you speak to, the people that you consult with, which almost are like the laws of success of YouTube?
Sean Cannell:	Yeah. I actually have a training called the Three Irrefutable Laws of YouTube Success. A caveat here is that my point of view and who I help the most are teachers, coaches, consultants, people with a message, people that want to leverage YouTube to probably drive some kind of business result, and also impact people. While that can blur into kind of your new school creator, the way I summarize it is I help business-minded content creators.
These laws are also based on the fact that YouTube is a search engine. Now, I'm aware—I think that actually everybody can leverage that fact at different points in their YouTube career, different videos that they upload, but it's not maybe as relevant for peer entertainment channels or things like that.
The final caveat, these are two very good, specific examples, there's sometimes comedians and musicians will ask me, "Well Sean, how can I use these laws as a musician?" I say, "Here's the trouble being a musician: your music is either going to be good or bad and people are either going to like it or not. If you title your video right to rank it for such and such cover of a song, look, that's going to be determined by if the market likes that or not."
You have a little bit more of a, in my opinion, challenge. If you want to be a great comedian, you just need to get it out there and grind and put those videos out, or a musician, you need to level up your craft.
I actually think, and this is why I love teaching it, that it's a much more forgiving path to share your expertise, to share your knowledge, to actually be a guide to people that are just a few steps behind you. Whether that's in homeschool, and these are the people in our community, Heather Torres is actually on our team. She's helping people with homeschool. You've got Steve Panate who's helping people with real estate, leveraging YouTube to grow his real estate business. You've even got Dad Verb who is video production and freelance video per day. He's got his own agency, but then he does a Dad Verb channel, parenting channel, to review strollers and different things.
So almost a way to put it would almost be practical. Not that I don't help motivational and inspirational people, but that I love the practical path of YouTube, and these laws apply to that, and they start with this: Number one: research before you press record. That's the first law.
It's everything. That's why I love tools like vidIQ, and KeywordsEverywhere.com, and why I love even YouTube itself. That gives us those predictions and the auto-complete. That can give us insights into the exact videos that we should make.
I've learned that random acts of content typically don't work, unless you're a meme account and being random is your message or you're a comedian and that is what has worked for you. You want to be strategic, specific, starting with the end in mind.
When you use the powerful tools of research, you can not only come up with the specific video ideas you should be making, you also are now going to be leveraging the fact that YouTube is a search engine, and so that you are giving your content the best possible opportunity for not just getting views when you upload it to your subscribers, but being viewed by new people for weeks, months, and years to come, leveraging YouTube search.
Liron Segev:	Absolutely. Research, research, research, research. So many people pick up the camera, will film. We've all seen them at events. They're walking around with their GorillaPods and filming for hours on end, and then they have three SD cards full of hours of videos. Now what?
But if they did their research, and they knew that they wanted to come out with five tips to make your YouTube videos better, they'll shoot five tips and they're done because they know people are searching for that. I cannot stress this enough. Totally echo that. Research, research, research, unless you really have a following on TikTok or Instagram and you're leveraging that audience to come across to YouTube. If you're starting at zero, research is so, so key, and YouTube is that search engine that wants to marry a query, a question, with an answer. Be the answer. Love that. Hit us with law number two.
Sean Cannell:	Law number two then is rank your videos. The purpose of your research is to get that video ranked. Now, here's my definition of ranked videos: there's of course search, which is if someone types in an inquiry, homeschool versus public school, in the search box, and then there's the top result, there's a second result, there's a third result. Those are ranked videos. They're ranking for a particular search query.
Heather Torres, on her homeschool channel, when she made that video, it ranked in search based on how she created the content and how she optimized it, and therefore, she grew her channel so far to 13,000 subscribers, which are focused homeschool moms that are wanting to just learn and grow. That is ranking and search.
But we know that, actually, the largest traffic source on YouTube is suggested videos. What I've discovered is I define ranking as both. Ranking is search and suggested. Ranking simply means that you're getting seen. Suggested video, in a way, is a ranked video. It's YouTube saying, "This is worthy of being put on the sidebar because of the minutes watched, because of the consumption," and that's the one-two punch of YouTube. When I look at my traffic, a lot of times we get about 1.5 million views a month on Think Media, and about 40% is usually suggested videos and 20 to 30% is search, but the practices, the tactics, I believe, of doing search right, gives you much more leverage for suggested. When you get that mix right, you'll leverage both and you can experience the dream.
When a video is ranked, the dream, for me, is views while you snooze. Think Media gets roughly 2,000 to 3,000 views every 60 minutes, whether I upload new videos or not. Crazy powerful and that is search and suggested traffic predominantly.
Liron Segev:	Well, there's a couple of things on that. Firstly, you said that her channel's got 13,000 subscribers, but you also said a very, very keyword here, which is focused. It's not a numbers game, which is the vanity metrics is driving me insane, which people just think, "I've got to get subscribers. I've got to get subscribers. Sub for sub. Let me just get as many numbers of my channel as possible." If you're doing this as a business and you're looking to grow a course, you're looking to get more people through the front door of your shop, you're doing it with a business intent in mind, it's not a numbers game; it's the right number game. So it's the intent that's absolutely critical to that. I love the idea of focus and in fact, and I think you actually told me this once, that nothing will suck the joy out of YouTube faster than comparing it to other people.
Sean Cannell:	Absolutely. You know, what's interesting is I think it would probably be encouraging for people to hear that you also never know what's going on under the surface. You never know what someone's CPM is. Someone might be getting 10 million views a month, but their CPM is 50 cents, and you might be getting a fraction of that, but your CPM is $10. Furthermore, you don't know what's happening on the backend of their business. So many people judge on the surface.
This comes our way a lot. They'll say, "Man, you don't need to get views," like some troll gamer kids somewhere, and I'm like, "That's fair." Because if you compare that to a Jake Paul or a PewDiePie, then correct. Compared to that, I'm just a blip on the radar. But let's flip that. 1.5 million views a month is insanity! That is a crazy amount of traffic and this 16-year-old, is actually probably a 36-year-old living in his mom's basement with four subscribers, is commentating on how many views we're getting, also not realizing that there's an entire business model behind that's generating multiple seven figures.
You just never know what's really happening and too many people, yeah, they're judging by the surface. They're judging vanity metrics, what's happening on the surface, and they don't really even understand how the game works.
Liron Segev:	All right, so that was two laws. What's the third?
Sean Cannell:	The third law is then reoccurring revenue. To recap, number one, research before you press record. Now you're going to make the right video for the right audience. Then you want to rank your videos. We could share resources. Obviously, the book. We didn't really go into how, but if you could pull that off. Number three though, you need this, you want to have reoccurring revenue in place.
Why are these the laws of YouTube success? Well, by the definition of these three laws, success in my mind is freedom; you're using YouTube for leverage. You're achieving that goal of generating revenue from YouTube, not like you would generate revenue from going to work at your job. I worked at Red Robin, a hamburger place here in America, for ten years. I was a busser, I waited tables, and so I knew what it was to go in and I traded time for money.
What I'm after here with these laws is leverage and freedom because if you are making the right videos, they're ranked in search, therefore they work for you when you're not working, but only if law number three is in place, and that is reoccurring revenue is set up.
Now what's cool about YouTube is if you are getting views while you snooze, like our friend Sonny so famously said, if you're doing that, then you are making ad revenue. That actually can be pretty great. We could maybe do a conversation some other time about feature YouTube accounts or niche YouTube accounts. I got a friend, he's got 15 channels. He's making $100,000 a month just in ad revenue. He's not in the videos. So ad revenue actually really can be a strategy, it can create leverage of course, and people realize that, but in a significant way.
But then I'm into probably the second biggest one is affiliate marketing because if videos are relevant to affiliate marketing where you're doing product reviews, tutorials of some kind, when those videos are viewed while you're sleeping, you also are making sales through affiliate marketing.
I will say this: I'm less of a fan of brand deals, and more and more, my mindset has been shifting about brand deals based on some of my mentors and stuff, and that's just my personality. I hate having a boss. If I'm working with four or five different companies, it increases my stress level because I've got four or five bosses. While there are just very few brands that we love working with because it's just a great synergy, it's almost like family, my favorite is really taking your power back and building a business on your own terms.
That monetization strategy is sell something. Your income is correlated by the amount of buy buttons you have on your website. The listener might say, "Well shoot, I don't even have a website." Okay. Well, then I don't know. I guess you could send someone to a PayPal, but thing one. Thing two, how many buy buttons are on your website? Well, zero. Well, if your income is correlated to the amount of buy buttons you have on your website, then we might have a problem of why you're not making any income.
What's really exciting, because again, going back to vanity metrics, there's that famous article, I'm sure you've brought it up before, many of your listeners have probably heard it, Kevin Kelly, 1,000 True Fans.
Look, you don't need a million subscribers, 100,000, or even 10,000; but you need 1,000 true fans, and however you serve them, whether that's through a box that comes out every quarter, some kind of a digital course, some kind of merch, some kind of physical product, some kind of white label or outsource or eComm, if you want to create this freedom business embracing the power of YouTube online video, and impacting people in the process, then setting up reoccurring revenue streams is hugely important.
This might go without saying, but I actually kind of want to emphasize it here. It's this: you need to make more money. A listener might be like, "Yeah! Tell me about it. That's a moot point." But no, I actually think that a lot of creators, that's why we help business-minded content creators, and a lot of content creators are not business-minded.
Our views towards money are very interesting, right? It's how we're raised. We can sometimes have different mindsets. When I say you need to make more money, it's because I hope that you're listening and you've got a big dream, you've got a big vision, you've got a vision that's bigger than money, but it's going to take money. I think that sometimes, we have that starving artist perspective, and that can really put a lid on us as creators.
It's like look, you need to make revenue because doing this is hard. You've got to hire a team eventually. But also, you've got to make revenue because is your vision bigger than you? I've heard some people say, "You know what? I only need enough money for myself and my family," and they view that as contentedness, which I respect. In my opinion, that's selfish. Why? Because there's more needs around planet earth than just you and your family. So if you have the ability to create content, build your influence, generate revenue, make way more than you think.
People are still like, "Okay. Yes, I would love to." But I actually think it has to fit into the framework of why because reasons come before results. A lot of creators plateau, I even think they burnout because they hit a certain level of success. This YouTube thing can rush in and you can experience success, you can experience money, but they don't necessarily know how to manage it or know how to build a business, or how to actually keep their own fire lit. Sometimes they drift a little and maybe because their vision needs to expand.
So anyways, I just encourage people, when you set up that reoccurring revenue, now you can build more momentum. How amazing is it that you could actually pay somebody else and help feed their kids, build their family, that you could bring people together with you and actually build a movement all around this fact of YouTube? But the only reason that's going to happen is if you create leverage because you can't be working 60, 70, 80 hours a week trying to feed the YouTube machine, grinding it out, as a solopreneur forever. You've got to create leverage. You want to rank your videos and have reoccurring revenue streams so you can continue to make a greater impact and go forward with your mission.
Liron Segev:	The more money that you make, which by the way, I don't understand why people almost feel bad for saying that, it's almost like they hide their head in shame, go, "Well, I'm making X-number of dollars per month out of my YouTube." Good. That's the point of this because conferences cost money, travel costs money, meeting costs money. Would you suggest that people go into YouTube with the end in mind? In other words, go into YouTube thinking of this as a business and therefore everything revolves around a business mission?
Sean Cannell:	I would suggest what you said first, absolutely, that they should start with the end in mind, but I wouldn't say that it has to be a business mission. I think that what you said first is what's so important. Having real personal clarity on the fact of is this meant ... This is actually a conflict, not really a conflict, but it's something that we talk about in our community a lot in the sense of people, they want YouTube to be their full-time job, but they pick a niche or something that couldn't even support that.
Here's an example. Only around 8,000 people a month search for underwater basket weaving. Now actually, you could make underwater basket weaving a full-time job. Of course you could, you probably could build different revenue streams, but only 8,000 people a month means the market size is not very large.
You've got to start with the end in mind. If you say YouTube is a creative outlet for me, it is something. You might have a target to say, "You know what? I hope to earn an extra $5 to $10,000 a year so that YouTube is going to be our hobby channel and our vacation money," and you set a clear vision like that, you put a level of hustle in it, you love doing it, but you don't ... I mean, I'm not saying you have to build a team and scale.
It's completely predicated on your vision, but if you flip it because that's where people are out of alignment; people are saying, "Yo, I want to be a millionaire," and then they start an underwater basket weaving channel and they're frustrated because it's not growing as fast. The market you're in, your niche, your business model, your plan is incongruent with your aspirations.
That's probably the way to summarize it. If you can get clear ... I heard a quote, "Definitiveness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement." It's hard to figure that out. It's easier said than done, but that's why, in our book, chapter one, the first law of the seven secrets of YouTube success is clarity. Start with the end in mind.
Yeah, you just want to be clear on your goals, and I think something to consider is be clear on your goals of the whole picture. If I'm open, I know that YouTube, for as much good as it's done, it's pulled out probably some negative tendencies in me as well. The algorithm is kind of vicious. And I don't mean vicious by not ranking videos. It is a content monster that ... I actually really feel like, unchecked, it can drive you to burnout. It can drive you to just keep feeding it, keep hustling, keep grinding.
Early on, when we were talking about comparison and vanity metrics, I think that's the other thing to consider too. What is your vision for your lifestyle? What is your vision for balance? What is it you ultimately want to build? That's so personal.
A lot of times though, we don't think through those things, and we just charge the one mountain of views or of a target of money, but you want to think about that big picture.
Kind of to wrap back to that, that's why you also don't really want to judge because some people are choosing to work 60, 70, 80-hour weeks on this, and of course their numbers are probably going to be superior. But if you just say, "I want to upload one video every two weeks. I figured out a few income streams because I want to be able to have more time and margin with my family. I've got a bunch of kids," everyone's in different seasons and the people I respect the most are the people that, really, they're thoughtful and they just have wisdom about what's right for them. They figured out ... It's no judgment. If someone wants to crush it all day long, or on the other side, someone is on a slower pace, well, of course the numbers or the growth is going to be incongruent there-
But that person may be living the most wise life that's more to be modeled because there is kind of a dark side to this YouTube thing that can almost take over your lifetime and mind, and we can forget how to be human.
Liron Segev:	Exactly it. It's your personal situation. You cannot compare someone with four kids, mortgages, school fees, all of those bills that come with it, to someone whose mom and dad are willing to pay for their lifestyle whilst in the Hamptons, they're making vlogging videos. The two worlds are so far apart, your responsibilities are different, your time-constraints are different. Again, we're going back to the whole stop comparing, run your own race, but be smart about the race that you're trying to run. My problem with the algorithm at the moment, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, do you think that because of the algorithm, it's almost killing creativity because we have to play to the way the algorithm wants to work?
Sean Cannell:	You know, that's an interesting question that's pulling out, maybe, some deeper stuff here. To me, that is the conflict of artist and businessperson. So, the first answer's yes. I do actually think, at some level, it is killing creativity.
I do think that, if we get super introspective, we could just take that because obviously, people that are super creative, certain artistic videos, certain creative videos that are outside of the box win, still, on YouTube here and there or whatever, but overall, no, I agree with you because what YouTube is saying, especially now with YouTube Studio Beta, how clear it was ... I threw up a video that's a little off-brand and it's like you're down 56%, your subscribers have no interest in this. And you're like, "Well, when was it just ... What if I wanted to create a video?"
That's what I mean about the tension between being an artist and being a creative or a business-minded person. I think that is, it's interesting. It's almost like two different personalities, but you're good if you can blend them.
I'll tell you this. For me, this is the way I do it. I'm not saying this is right. I am on YouTube for a mission that's bigger than YouTube. I'm on YouTube to accomplish things but my life is not about just YouTube. Therefore, in my opinion, business actually takes priority over creativity. Some people, that would rub them the wrong way and that's why maybe they don't want to follow me or whatever because they're just more like, even though extremely business-minded, they may be more like Casey Neistat. They just maybe want to follow a creative, kind of that person who is such an artist spirit, so they resonate with that.
That's completely fine. Whoever you vibe with. But I go into YouTube, it is my passion, I love helping people, but I also want to create leverage so I can spend time with my wife, my family. Does that make sense?
The reason artists are often times starving is because they're not thinking about business marketing. I know that went a lot of ways from the algorithm, but yeah, it's kind of almost an unfortunate, but I understand it. I respect that it's about economics and ad revenue, and yeah, I think you have to play in that framework.
For the artist that maybe feels they can't do that, it's like well, there's not much you can do about it. You could just share it on another platform. Keep trying to share it. Try to get your art seen.
I actually think that there's a great book that can blend the two, and I don't think they have to be at war, and it's called Real Artists Don't Starve by Jeff Goins. I definitely recommend that because I think that to maybe even have a better relationship with the algorithm. There's probably a lot of people, maybe if they've got stress in their marriage or with their partner, maybe they're stressed with the algorithm. We have a love-hate relationship. There's some drama in our relationship.
I think Real Artists Don't Starve is just that idea that look, the game is the game, however it changes. A, you need to pay attention. You need to be always current and updated and aware, and that's why this podcast and stuff you do and tools are so important. You've got to pay attention. And then what happens, and Gary Vee talks about this a lot, what creators and all of us and business owners, you just get romantic about things. You wish it was a certain way. You wish that artists were more ... We wish independent creators were more represented in YouTube Rewind or something, and we can just wish, and complain, and worry about everything that's going on.
And by the way, YouTube should be paying attention, as they are, and making changes and not offending the creator community. But we're living in the area of just offense, excuses, complaining, blaming algorithms. It just is what it is! You just have to succeed or not in that framework and not wish it was some other way.
Liron Segev:	And we live in such an echo chamber that we create for ourselves. We follow the same people who think the same as we do, so it's the whole round circle, tap each other on the back situation. When you go, "The algorithm sucks. YouTube hates my channel," you're going to get a whole bunch of people saying, "Yes, the algorithm's bad. Yes, they hate your channel."
It's this echo chamber, but it's also about the balance. So yes, you want to put out a creative message into the world, but don't forget, YouTube is just a tool. You might do better on TikTok. You might do better on Instagram. It's just a leverage. It's just yet another lever that you can pull to get your message out there. But I think blaming the algorithm for all the ills of the world, I think that's a flawed logic too. There's a balance between business, talking to your community, engaging with your audience, and what's this thing called the AI and what's it going to do to my metadata and what's it going to do with my video?
I do find it interesting because it is almost a conflict, but we have to understand it, and I agree that when you log into your dashboard, your new Studio Beta dashboard, and it's very glaringly obvious in your face saying, "You're down 50%," what? Now you've got to start thinking, "What am I doing wrong?" Well, it's not that. You've just got to have a different perspective. Think of that video in isolation compared to your channel as a whole. I found, and I'd like your opinion on this as well, do you find people look at individual videos and then make decisions based on that and therefore, "My channel sucks. It didn't do well. I'm quitting"? Should they be looking at a channel as a holistic tool versus just one-on-one videos?
Sean Cannell:	Absolutely. I think that not only looking at your channel as a holistic whole, but also not judging too soon. My biggest recommendation when people are starting YouTube is I say, "Look, not until you get to your first 30," but what I want to say, and sometimes say is, "Actually, not until you get to your first 100 uploads do I think you're even starting."
It's almost like if you go to the gym — which I don't do, so I don't even know how I have this information — it's almost like if you go to the gym and you haven't been in years and you're out of shape, not only do you not have the form, but you could barely lift the weights, so it's all ugly. Your arms are wobbling. You walk in, everyone's like ... Some gym shark dude's got the hat, shirt, Beats headphones, and you're coming in, you don't have the right clothes, the right form, you don't know anything. You're scrawny. Whatever. You've got to show up 100 times to even actually start exercising right.
The same thing's true on YouTube. I see people that they're like, "Yo, your stuff doesn't work. I've been following Video Influencers. I can't believe your stuff doesn't work." I'm like, "Okay. Fair. Let me look into your stuff." Click through on their channel. Bro, you have three uploads in the last six months.
You can't even say whether it works or not, and even if you had 30 uploads, what I still say is true. I think that you're still in a learning, self-discovery, finding your voice, refining your message, getting through the production process, the workflow process, and most people, that's actually the season where they get stuck. There's the start season. Immediate follows it is stuck. You start, and then you're like, "Okay. I put out a video. Took me five hours, ten hours, fifteen hours and it got five views. Shoot, I make more money at my minimum wage job." Of course you do because you're just starting.
But over time, you're going to create that leverage and build that momentum. If you can press through that season, there's so many rewards on the other side. But that goes back to the beginning of the call. You have to walk through the season of suck, I will fear no evil. It's like hey, I'm in it, man.
This the season of finding my voice. So I would agree, look at it as a whole. And then the thing, if we play both sides though, when you said is it based on one video, you probably even know more about me than the algorithm, but from what I've been studying lately, YouTube seems to be in this place where, this is what I'm hearing, that if you have two bad uploads in a row, that it's going to affect that third upload in relation to how much velocity it got right there, like it said it Studio Beta. To your point, yes, the algorithm, unfortunately, not only is it killing creativity, but it's actually almost forcing your content in a certain direction. It's saying, "Look, only give us what works. Therefore, if that means changing your message or only talking about certain topics," it's frustrating, and that's the tension of only being business and algorithm-minded.
But on the flip side, again, it is weird to judge that because we could take it so personally and forget that okay, hey, this is a free platform that you're making money on.
I do think it's interesting. I come from a faith background so I follow some different, of course, preachers online, and I was actually hearing one talk about Instagram. I think it illustrates the same point because of course Instagram has an algorithm as well. What he was saying was look, there's certain clips of messages that are just kind of going to naturally go viral. They're just the shareable thing, they're the thing that everyone wants to click like on, and they just blow up. He goes, "And then there's things though that why did this get 50,000 view.
Unfortunately, the algorithm or even the way people interact with it, it's not always going to go viral, but it's important.
Can you blend the two? That's the dance. Can you then put out what YouTube wants and what placates your subscribers and whatever, and then also balance that with weaving in the stuff that you're like, "Man, I don't know if this will be popular, but it's important so I know I need to publish it"?
Do you find that on your channel with some of the tech stuff you used to do way back then is still delivering money into your bank account?
Sean Cannell:	Of course. We're going to generate over $200,000 profit just from the Amazon associates program this year. Which is insane. I think that's $4 to $6 million in top line sales for Amazon, which is something by the way, you talk about branding and writing about bios and things, and I actually have helped all kinds of clients that have different types of businesses, but early on, that was one of my authority positioning pieces. I said, "I've helped my clients, at the time, generate millions of dollars because I've helped Amazon generate millions of dollars." It is totally true. Directly.
Almost in a direct sales type of environment because content is putting that out and then generating those profits. But yeah, so many older tech videos, older videos from affiliate marketing. People don't know a lot of times I've got a channel, Sean Cannell, my personal channel. I'll sometimes review health products. There was one, it was like a green juice powder, and my friend Lewis Howes mentioned it to me so I tried it for a while, loved it, found out they had an affiliate program. But what I also like looking for is programs that are outside of Amazon's 4 to 10%. In this case, this was 30%.
And continuity. If they subscribed to a bottle a month of this green juice powder that you mix with water for health on the go and when you travel, and that's one of my main passions personally. I put this video out, put the affiliate link in the description below. It actually went through ClickBank as an affiliate network. Put that link down there. That video has generated $200 to $300 a month, roughly $3,000 a year, for four or five years.
And I made it four or five years ago and it just keeps bringing in ... That was absolutely one of the ways I got to where I was today was video-by-video. It was almost like I viewed those things like a project and it wasn't just a video, but once I worked on it, got it in place, on the one hand, $300 a month when you start out, that's not going to pay your rent and feed your family and feed your kids, but how many of those videos, those mini-projects could you get in place?
Well, now you can start seeing how practical it could be to have $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 a month. Now that's life-changing money. Now that's you doing this full-time. That has been a major strategy for me and that's why I love ranked videos and these laws because when you get these things in place with reoccurring revenue like that, it's a complete game-changer.
Liron Segev:	Game-changing is what this is all about. It can be. People want their dream, but I always question how hungry are they to get it? And how often are they going to turn around and say, "Well, this algorithm is screwing me. I'm now giving up" versus people who say, "You know what? Okay, so it was a bad video. Next. I'm going to just carry on doing it, carry on hustling"?
At the end of the day, we just don't know what the algorithm is going to pick up and you could have old videos. It happened on my channel. A four-months-old video that I've long forgotten about just blew up, almost doubled my subscriber base in 20 days, just from that one video alone. What do I do? I double-down. Make more of the same content. The algorithm loves all of that. It's my top search term now on coming to my channel.
My point is that you just never know, but if you're not willing to put in the effort of this whole overnight success takes a couple of years situation, you've got to put in the legwork. You've got to put in the groundwork for you to get those rewards so you can get that passive income. A couple of hundred bucks of month is not a lot, but a couple of hundred bucks times lots of videos, well, that's amazing. That is beautiful money that is some people's vacation money, some people's college down payment. It could be anything and those can be life-changing kind of money. Is there anything that's got you super, super pumped right now?
Sean Cannell:	You know, as we are in this deep conversation with YouTube, I'm super pumped about online video in general, and here's my list.
YouTube's still number one for me. Number two for me, close number two and three, is Instagram video and LinkedIn video. I think that these are some tactical stuff for people right at the end too. I think Instagram TV, it was dead. It just kind of was. But once they started distributing in the feed, it was revived, and now it's a big deal because now there's that crossover. If you're executing well with content in the feed, you get that 60-second preview, and then they can complete watching it over on your IGTV. It's all blended together.
I don't think it should surprise us that Instagram wasn't just going to roll over and stay down. They are in the boxing ring. Of course, going to continue to evolve.
I think there's a lot of opportunity, especially dare I say, dare I even utter these words, that if you are at absolute zero, that there's some, I think, wisdom to consider Instagram, or number three, LinkedIn video as ... That's probably the most open season, the most favorable, organic reach algorithm right now. As this message has been ... For me, it was 2018 VidCon when they did the first-ever LinkedIn video creators panel, and I was like, "Phew, yeah right. What is a LinkedIn video creator? What is this?" And I was early to see that. Those people were early because it'd only been a few months old at that time, but LinkedIn, and we're there. We're being present in those places.
YouTube number one; LinkedIn and Instagram, in either order, two and three; number four, paid video ads. We didn't even go there. Maybe it's a conversation for the future place.
But paid traffic. Again, when I say it's irresponsible for you not to be on YouTube, I'm talking to the person who is on the sidelines and on the fences right now for not going all-in in this most remarkable time in history. We're living through the greatest communication shift in the last 2,000 years, and organic, free ability to build your influence, income, and impact is a major reality, as we've talked about, on YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn. But paid is this whole other piece that's actually missing from a lot of entrepreneur's businesses. There's a learning curve. You've got to figure it out.
By the way, you'll lose money. You'll make mistakes. We spent $10,000 on ads once that barely ROIed. It was super frustrating, took a ton of energy, we were super exhausted, and that kind of thing could make you disillusioned and say, "Huh, should I do this anymore?"
But my friends, paid LinkedIn ... Not actually LinkedIn for me, but that's relevant too. Paid Instagram video ads, static ads, Facebook, YouTube. We do all of those in our business. Loved or hated by some people, but those people who love and hate, I've never ran into any of those people at the bank. None of them have ever ... We've crossed paths. I've never seen any of them there. People can critique it, but look, if you believe in your message and your mission, and that's what I think it comes down to, and really, that doubt could be in people's hearts because if you really believe in your message, your mission, your products, your motives, your intentions, then why would you ever put a cap on how many people you could reach with your message, your products, your mission?
Therefore, paid traffic, it's not just a 10x your business type of thing; it's a 100x, 1,000x your business type of thing. That's what we've experienced. And by the way, we do both. It's not either/or in our opinion, it's both. As an entrepreneur, I say, "If there are tools that are available to me, why would I not leverage and maximize them?" That's one of those tools.
So I encourage people. I'm so pumped about online video. I'm playing in probably those four verticals the most. I'm YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and paid ads across the board. That's the four horseman of the apocalypse right there if you can execute on those well.
Liron Segev:	Well, on that note, if the rest of us can't even keep up with one platform, Sean's channels, Sean's platforms are absolutely something to keep an eye on because one thing's for sure: when he figures this stuff out because Sean will break them, and when he figures how to do it, he'll simply make a video about it teaching the rest of us. So Sean, where can people get a hold of you? What have you got going on that people need to be aware of? Hit us with some links, some things for us to check out.
Sean Cannell:	Yeah. YouTube Secrets, definitely if people haven't checked it out. It's on audiobook now. TubeSecretsAudio.com, if you don't have Audible. I'm sure most do, but you can always grab it free when you do an Audible trial. Check that out.
Think Media. Just go to the YouTube search bar and type in the word Think Media. And Video Influencers, Video Influencer. Think Media's going to help you with tactics and strategies, but also a lot of the tech gear, the lighting. And then of course, Video Influencers, weekly interview show. Do that with my good friend Benji Travis and co-author of YouTube Secrets.
And then finally, I just love connecting with people. Twitter, ironically, I had to bring it up, but I think Twitter is a social platform to me. It's the networking party, it's the chance to hang out with people and have conversations. We definitely publish there, but I love conversations the most and not just publishing content, so @SeanCannell. If you find me on Twitter, I would love to connect with you there if you've got questions or anything, especially if you listen to this podcast. We talked about some really cool things, so let me know if you listened to the podcast and let me know if you have any questions. I would love to connect.
Liron Segev: Sean, thank you very much one more time. Amazing chats. Always inspiring to us. Whenever we get together, it's always amazing stuff.
Sean Cannell:	Thank you so much. The honor is all mine.

How to Grow a YouTube Channel: A Creator Story: Full Transcript
Liron Segev: Dave, thanks for hanging out with us. I've got to start by telling you, I have seen your content grow. I've seen your content mature. What took so long to get onto YouTube? Do you think by waiting, you actually have an advantage when you did switch over to YouTube?
Dave Maze:	Some of that maturity, like over those 10 years before I became a YouTuber, has all helped me now. If I just started straight out of high school from being a magician to figuring out how to be a filmmaker, like I don't know, part of me is like I should've started earlier, but then the other side is like, there's a lot of maturity that happened.
To answer your question, I think anybody can start where they are, if they have the awareness of, "I want to be a YouTuber." I just never thought YouTube was anything. I just saw Ryan Connolly on Film Riot and I was like, that's awesome that he's doing that. I don't really care to do that. I just want to be a filmmaker. You mentioned that everybody brings up Casey Neistat, but I think he really, for a lot of filmmakers, changed our perspective on YouTube, because now we have people like Levi Allen, obviously Peter McKinnon, Matti Haapoja now. These are real freelance, DPs, directors who traditionally, 20 years ago, probably would have done commercials, maybe music videos and films, and because Casey's showing us as a filmmaker, I can be a YouTuber, it's okay.
By the way, you can actually make a good living doing it. You can actually do what you want to do. Just lower the production value a little bit. We've seen a big kind of influx of filmmakers transitioning over to being YouTubers.
Liron Segev:	Again, you don't have to be perfect. People have got lots of forgiveness on YouTube, and they want to see the raw element of this and they want to see the bloopers and they want to see that not everything is perfect. If you're living in a van in the middle of the desert and people come out with full makeup, you know they haven't showered in three days, you know it's fake and people don't respond. They don't respond to that. They respond to someone being real. Being real, I think, is a big, big thing on YouTube. Do you believe that's an important kind of element of finding your space in this world?
Dave Maze:	I think so. I worked for a guy named Dave Ramsey. That was my corporate job that I had. If you're not familiar with Dave Ramsey, millions of people listen to his radio show. He teaches people how to get out of debt and stuff like this, but there's actually some polarizing things that he believes in his messaging that a lot of people sometimes agree with, sometimes disagree with, but he doesn't care. He sticks to his opinion. When I started doing these tech reviews, I saw some people being a little wishy-washy, being maybe manipulated by, I want to please this brand, or whatever.
It was actually a guy named Caleb Pike, DSLR video shooter, who told me "I don't work for the camera companies. I will not receive anything from them. I am working for my audience. That's who matters. It's not Canon or Sony or Nikon.” Sure, I can be friendly with the employees, I don't want to be a jerk, but I'm not here to please them. I'm here to give my opinion and have a true opinion and stick to it and give that to my audience," because that's first off, people are attracted to people with an opinion whether they agree or disagree.
It doesn't matter because if you disagree, you're going to let me know in the comments, which boosts my engagement. If they agree, they become a fan, right? That's kind of the big realization I had was I need to have an opinion on something, stick to it and not be a jerk about it. But that will gather a niche following of people who agree with me, but then also people who disagree. They can comment if they want and leave a dislike. There's always dislikes, like no matter what. I post a video and then in five minutes, there's like two dislikes.
Liron Segev:	How do you balance between working with a brand, and you have to do a review on their competitor. Do you find it a bit awkward because you're like loyal to the one brand because you really love their gear, but you still want to give a fair review of their competitor?
Dave Maze:	Sure. Well, I think there's two answers to that. First off, if you're somebody like Jason Vong, who's a good friend of mine, he's kind of like the Sony guy. If he picked up a GH5 or a Canon, his audience would kind of be like, "What the heck?" He actually told me that he reviewed the GH5 and everybody was like, "Why are you doing this?" There is that aspect of it. If you're a Canon guy, like Peter McKinnon who chooses to switch to Sony, like ... Well first off, that would blow up the internet. Everybody would freak out, but it's almost like you wouldn't see that happen.
Because I'm an unbiased ... I feel like I'm a journalist rather than I'm dedicated to one brand. I hope that people understand that as a journalist it's my job to just kind of be unbiased.
Liron Segev:	At the end of the day, like on my channel, I do tech reviews, right? I've got to remember, just as you do, people are going to make a buying decision, or you're going to help someone make a buying decision, either for or against. I always say, look, in my experience, and this is my use case for it, this worked really well, and that stuff really didn't work well.
Now if somebody else has got a different user experience or use case, that may or may not work for them, but at least I'm giving it from a perspective. Now you've got enough information to say, "Okay, I can kind of lean in towards one direction." I think it would be very disingenuous of both of us to say, "Well, brand X sent me this gear, so it's amazing and there isn't a single negative." It doesn't really kind of work that way.
Dave Maze:	Exactly. I don't just put something negative in for the sake of negativity. I might go at it with an angle that might be attractive story-wise, but overall, if there's something that's really bad, I'm going to point it out. If it's really good, I'm going to point out too. I think a lot of people in my niche accuse us of being paid by these companies, and it's just not true. The truth is that once you get to a certain level, it is easy to get a hold of gear, but it doesn't mean that you're going to keep it.
I have a deal with B&H and they send me pretty much whatever I want, which is great because B&H is kind of an unbiased entity. I really like working with them because it's not Sony giving me a camera. It's B&H giving me a camera and they're unbiased. They sell everything.
Liron Segev:	Do you find that companies appreciate the fact that you've pointed something out and maybe they'll fix it in the next firmware upgrade, things of that nature?
Dave Maze:	Yeah, absolutely. It's actually really amazing to see what is happening in the industry right now. For example, we just brought this camera up, the G7 X Mark III from Canon, that's been one of the most popular vlogging cameras for the last couple of years. They haven't updated it in a long time. I think it's been three years or something, but this new iteration is clearly designed with the suggestions that YouTubers gave. The screen has been reinforced because people were breaking the screen. They added a mic input jack, which everybody in the whole wide world wanted. They're actually doing things.
I see that with Sony. They added a flip screen with the new a6400. Everybody wants a flip screen. It's interesting to see people make changes because these cameras are made by engineers, very smart, brilliant engineers. They're not necessarily using the camera daily. When we have, "Hey, when I use this camera, it overheats and this thing happens or whatever," they're like, "Oh, cool." If a bunch of people say that, then hopefully they can address it. It's pretty cool.
Liron Segev:	It makes sense for them to do it because they're getting feedback from their customers who just want a better product. When they make the better product, odds are pretty darn good that if this is the eight things you wanted fixed and they are fixed, you're going to buy that next product. It just kind of makes complete sense.
When you're planning out your content, how much of your analytics and your audience and your comments do you take into account versus like your content schedule that you already have set?
Dave Maze:	It's amazing how fluid my schedule is. I have a Trello board with a list of six videos for the month. I've discovered that I could have a list of 100 ideas and I never even look at the board. I actually minimalized my ideal list to only six.
If I come up with a new idea, I'll actually remove one. I always have a running list of six ideas. As soon as something happens, like say, the G7 X came out last week, that just bumped up to top priority. Basically, a lot of my decisions are based around what is trending, what is popular. I can see that through the analytics. I can see that through just like literally searching for stuff on YouTube. For example, this E-M1 Mark II camera that I'm shooting on, it's not going to get any views, I know it, because nobody's searching for it. Nobody cares about it, but I personally care about it. I try to balance it with like, here's one for me. You've heard this, one for me, one for
I probably do more for them and maybe once a month one for me, but I'm looking at my engagement. I now am looking through at the click-through rate. It’s great that we have that analytic now. Obviously Mr. Beast is really showing everybody how important that is. That's a new thing I'm going to start implementing, but we were looking at our analytics. I had this really nice little 15-second intro video on the beginning of every video. We lost 40% of retention as soon as that happened. So, we just took it out and it fixed it. Now we actually have retention all the way through at a much better percentage.
I'm constantly looking at those things. I think as a creative, as a filmmaker, as an artist or whatever you want to call it, and it sounds really pretentious, but I always have to remember that I did start out as an artist. That's the whole point. Sometimes art doesn't necessarily go in with analytics. If I have a lead-in or a scene that people are going to drop off, but it adds to the story in a way that I like, then maybe I'll just leave it in anyway, because at the end of the day I want to have my YouTube channel serve my longterm career, which is to continue to direct, to create, to produce.
It's not always about the YouTube stuff for me because in 30 years I might not want to be a YouTuber anymore and I might want to produce shows. I might want to produce other things. Everything I'm doing is serving that goal of like I want this to be art. I don't want it to necessarily be all numbers, but at the same time, I look at the numbers too.
Liron Segev:	It's a balance. This is why I'm finding, and maybe you are finding as well, that it's always a struggle between the algorithm and creativity. Sometimes I do think that YouTube is killing creativity because we are so busy playing to the algorithm and that's a problem.
Dave Maze:	Well, that's why I'm starting this other channel, my personal channel, justDave Maze. I'm just going to do comedy stuff and I'm not even going to look at the numbers. I'm going to do what I do. I'm going to know what is trending. I'm going to know what will hit, but there are a lot of YouTubers like Jacksfilms who he'll make a 45 second video about him coughing on a loop and it's got millions of views. It's a stupid video. It's really short. It's not 10 minutes. There's no subscribe at the beginning. Yet, he's doing really well. There's a balance of that. Liron Segev:	There's a balance somewhere.
I want to experiment with that because with Kinotika, I really am following more of the format of a traditional tech reviewer, but trying to add a comedy flair to it, but making it my own.
Liron Segev:	At the end of the day, to stand out in this very crowded space, you've got to bring your own voice. All right, so as we wrap up here, this is my plug myself moment dot com here. Where can people find you?
Dave Maze:	Sure. Well, obviously the big tech channel is calledKinotika. It was created by a Chinese man who is also Russian. The spelling of it's a little peculiar, but it's special. It's different. It's unique. Yeah, Kinotika. I also host a podcast called Golden Hour. Just search in Apple podcasts or wherever you get podcasts,the Golden Hour podcast.
Liron Segev:	Great podcast, by the way.
Dave Maze:	I interview influencers, Instagrammers, YouTubers, different people. Then onTwitterandInstagram, Dave Maze, underscore at the end.
Liron Segev:	It has to have that underscore.
Dave Maze:	The people took it. I'll get it eventually, probably. One of them is dead. The other one is like a porn account so don't go there. Thankfully I've had enough tweets now where if you search my name, that doesn't come up. Hopefully Twitter will give that to me one day, but for now, just avoid it.
Liron Segev:	Again, everything will be in the show notes, so we'll make sure we'll send you to the right account. Dave, thank you very much. Really appreciate your story and sharing with us kind of the journey, because it's not simple. There's not a straightforward ... It's not a linear line. They're going to be ups, there's going to be downs.
Dave Maze:	It's true.
Liron Segev:	It's just a ride. You've got to enjoy that ride as you're doing it because if you're not enjoying it, then it's work. Dave, thank you very much again.
Dave Maze:	Absolutely.

How to Stand Out From the YouTube Crowd: Full Transcript
Liron Segev:Todd, welcome to the show.
Todd Bergin:Thank you so much for having me on. It's a great pleasure to collaborate with you again.
LS:Let's give people the quick, who is Todd in a tweet, as I like to call it. What's the quick high level? Who is Todd?
TB:Oh, man, I don't even know that I could do that. It's more like who is Todd in a day, because it's going to take me a day to explain. I've been an entrepreneur all my life. I am a recovering attorney. I tried to fit into the career-type mold. It didn't work the way I wanted it to, but I left on my own terms. I've done a lot of different things, starting with eBay in 1998. Sold a million dollars' worth of stuff over the years over there.
I've been an internet entrepreneur ever since 1998, live video and podcasting, which is pretty much what I do now. I got started with live video first and got into podcasting. I've got two daily podcast shows. One focuses on Instagram marketing, called Grammer School. One is called Entrepreneur Live Video that focuses on, of course, live video, mastering my craft at internet broadcasting and helping other people master their craft as well.
LS:That's kind of the key message with you is you've always been a helper, a teacher. Is teaching your thing? Do you see yourself as a teacher first?
TB:Yeah. You know what? A lot of it's lead by example. If people see me doing things, then they want to know how I did the specific thing. A lot of the coaching clients that I get, they're like, "Hey. I saw this, and this is what I want. Or you sound great, this is what I want." I've actually built podcast studios and live video studios through Zoom, connecting with people in other parts of the country. I haven't actually connected with people in other parts of the world yet, but within the United States, I have and building awesome studios through Zoom. It's really kind of cool.
I love talking to people about who I like to learn from, so that they can go and discover these creators as well. I spend a lot of time learning from Owen Video. I mean if there's anybody out there that I look to in live streaming as somebody who is pushing the envelope in ways that I want to make sure that I see and can learn from, it's Owen. I share a lot of my thoughts on Owen, Stephanie Liu, Nick Nimmin, etc. I mean I've got a whole list of people.
LS:Another thing it's about, it's community. I think a lot of people have into their mindset that because we're both doing the same content, we must be rivals. We must be enemies. We must be competitors. That is absolutely just such a shocking mindset to have.
TB:When you have a local community, you only have so many people that are going to drive your location and visit you and spend money. On the internet, we have the whole world as potential customers. We reach the entire world. There are no limitations when it comes to getting work. The amount of people coming in to digital is endless. There's more than any one of us can handle, and there's probably more that all of us together can handle. As time rolls on, there will be new people to pop up to help carry the weight.
When you have the whole world as a potential customer base, you can engage with your potential competitors in an entirely different way. Instead of competing and being a rival, it's different. When you're local and you're small and you're dealing with competitors within your own local market there, I think it can be different.
LS:I mean I loved your story that you and I were chatting at one of the events where you were telling me about how someone was so scared of going live and you said "Forget it."
TB:Yeah, yeah. I was at Social Media Marketing World hosted, of course, by Michael Stelzner and Phil Mershon and wonderful show. I was at one of the tables. Now, for your audience who doesn't know or hasn't been to Social Media Marketing World, they have a big conference room with lots of tables. The tables all have numbers on them. Then, you get a chart or a legend for the room, so to speak, and you look up the number. You can say, "Okay. Table number 75, 76 and 77, those are all for the live streamers." You can go sit at that table and you'll be around people interested in live streaming. Usually, there's a few live stream guru types.
You just go and you chit-chat. You have some fun. Yes, I was having lunch one day and a girl from Michigan, I think it was, or Wisconsin, somewhere cold, was in town. We were talking. She said she had never live streamed before, and she's really wanting to do it. She had all these objections. I said, "Well what are your objections?"
She said, "Well I don't have anything to talk about right off the top." I just attacked it in a way. I said, "Okay. You're from Wisconsin or Minnesota. Have you ever been to San Diego before?" She said no and then we brainstormed content around that, and encouraged here to jump on Instagram Live right there and then, and she did it. She was a little apprehensive and it was all family mostly that came in. Everybody was cheering her on and having a good time. She was talking about it. I got on the camera for just a minute and told them I put her up to it. Her husband was very supportive. She gets off the phone and she turns and looks at me and she's crying. She's like, "That's one of the coolest things I've ever done." I didn't get her name, which kind of makes the story better. I might have gotten it, it's lost in my notes. It was a big moment for me that I changed somebody's life during my lunch.
LS:It seems to be you can go live on Facebook, you can go live on YouTube, of course, you can go live on Instagram. Now, LinkedIn is opening up a live platform. Is everyone supposed to be a broadcaster? Do you think everyone has a message to tell? Or do you think we're going to be seeing a lot of spam?
TB:I mean I think you can look to YouTube as an example for an answer to your question. YouTube is filled to the brim with junk, but with people like Sean Cannell, Nick Nimmin, Roberto Blake, I mean if you're providing immense value, then people are going to find you and they're going to subscribe. That's what matters. I remember when Sean Cannell's Think Media, I think, was under 500,000. It seemed like the next day, we were pushing 800 all of a sudden. The consumers are out there. They're savvy. They're going to find what they want. They're going to subscribe to what they want. It's the same thing with live video.
The difference with live video is people don't really... I don't think they really search for live video the way they search on YouTube for the recorded content. They're scrolling a feed and they find it. It's like, "Oh I'll go in." We have our way of sorting out our content and figuring out. I think that actually helps the good live streamers, the live streamers that are pushing the envelope and doing amazing things. I like to think I'm one of them. My problem has always been consistency.
I can do amazing things in live video, but I haven't even yet, in three or four years, established myself as a consistent live streamer with a consistent show. I can point to Stephanie Liu and Owen Video, I think the two of them, these people are consistent. They partner with brands or they don't, but they create variety shows that stick and keep people interested. They go from a 15 minute news segment to a 10 minute trivia segment to a half hour interview segment to maybe a housekeeping segment. They move the show along beautifully and keep the viewers until the end. People are going to come back to that. As people discover it more, their audiences are going to continue to grow.
LS:At the end of the day, curated content from prerecorded stuff versus live is just different. Once you kind of prerecord, it's beautiful, it's edited, it's scripted, it comes out as a perfect show. There will always be a space for that. Live is just it is what it is. It's just got to happen. It's not got to be perfect. It will be shaky at points. Maybe you'll lose audio at some points. You just roll with the punches. I think people actually appreciate seeing the real creator. Do you not find we might be facing an issue where because only one timeline, there's so much competition trying to vie for those eyeballs, that we're just going to get quantity over quality, what do you think?
TB:I think that, yes, you're completely right. We're all fighting for the one feed. It's tricky on all of these platforms. I've actually taken a big pivot. I attended Kajabi Summit, it was called Impact Summit, here in Irvine which was wonderful having it right down the street from my home. Kajabi really was a moment for me where I really started thinking about my website in a different way. They offered this thing called Community, which is basically like a Facebook Group within your website that you can put a paywall in front of and require passwords and that sort of thing. It's not open to the public, but it's for truly interested people to come and go from.
I'm looking at my website a different way and trying to make that the focus of everything I do now. I was watching somebody, it might have been Brendon Burchard, at the Kajabi Impact Summit. It was somebody. They said, "If your website isn't up to snuff and you're not leading people there with something to sell them, stop everything you're doing, all content creation on all platforms. Go and focus on your website until it's ready for sales, and then go back out and start funneling people into the website. You need to have every I dotted and T crossed before you go out and do that." So many people don't do that, including myself. I went out and just started creating content on Instagram and Facebook and all these other places, not really having somewhere very well designed to send people. That's changing for me, big time.
LS:Where we're evolving as a business, where we're evolving as an internet digital community, do you find that we're so fragmented?
TB:It's interesting. I don't even know how to explain it, because I don't know that I've given it a whole lot of thought. I'll tell you, when a major YouTuber, like Nick Nimmin, who is crushing it without podcasting, contacts me and says, "Who do you have to edit podcasts?" That tells me he's looking at podcasting as an option, which is really interesting. Podcasting is an old technology, but you've got these major YouTube presences that are looking. I mean Nick's not the only one. He's the only one that's contacted me and asked me that question. I know there's other major LinkedIn personalities that are getting into podcasting.
The interesting thing about podcasting is that, like you said, people are listening, they can do other things, but the bulk of people are listening to a podcast with their earbuds in. You really don't know who is out there. It's not always easy to move those people to other places, but I know they're out there. I know I'm having an impact on their life. I have a heat map in Simplecast that tells me where in the world people are downloading from, and how many episodes these various places people are downloading from. I've got people on every continent except for Antarctica. I'm always checking for a blip on Antarctica somehow. Maybe somebody in a weather station down there will download at some point.
I'm having this amazing impact. I'm filling a room. At 500 to 700 downloads a day, I mean I'm going to come to the conclusion that I have 400 to 500 people downloading on a daily basis. That's an amazing impact. People are listening to me from five to 15 minutes a day with their headset or in their car. I'm filling a large conference hall 365 days a year. It's an amazing thing. The connection's personal, because most of the time... In fact, I haven't had a guest on either of my podcasts in over a year. They're listening to me for the entire duration of the show. They're getting to know me and they're coming back for more.
I think in the long run, I mean it's hard to measure how it all plays out, but it has to be good. I think other people out there that are fighting algorithms in various places, I mean there is no algorithm with the podcast. You subscribe, you're going to get the download. It's a great way of getting content out there one-on-one. I talk to my crowd as though I'm talking to one person. I treat each episode as though it stands on its own, very rarely referencing other episodes. I just have fun with it, and people respond. Again, it's tough to measure the results.
A lot of businesses that are going to look at it and say, "Okay. What's my ROI?" Okay, what do you want in five years? Look at it as a long game. For me, it's a resume enhancement. I mean people hear that I've got over 500 episodes on two daily shows and, all of a sudden, it's like handing somebody a book you've written. I watched Chris Shrub one time. He was at VidCon and he went up on a booth that was interviewing people. He said, "Hey. Would you like to interview me?" They said, "Well who are you?" He handed them a book and they just went nuts.
Podcasting is a great thing, but I do see consolidation. For me, I've been all over the place. I don't care about Twitter. I don't care about Facebook. I care about LinkedIn only because they've added video. I think that LinkedIn offers opportunities for creators to connect with the workforce and people in office environments who are starting to look less at resumes and more at online presences as an indicator of what somebody brings that they might want to bring on the team for a temporary contract job or something more long-term. It might be a shocker to your audience, but all of my paid clients, since I've been doing any of this, found me on Instagram first.
Instagram has been valuable to me. The people that are finding me, all of my paid clients are mid-40s professional women who are knocking it out of the ballpark, who want to cut the time and the trouble out of getting to where I can get them. These are people that could figure it out on their own, but they make enough money on an hourly basis that it's actually... It makes sense for them to bring me onboard and just get a job knocked out. They're finding me there. I mean people think that Instagram is for kids. No, I don't think so. Not completely. Yeah, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn and my website, those are my focuses.
LS:Todd, before we kind of wrap up, I can see your focus. I love that point that you made, by the way, of your resume is your online presence. People will simply do a search and go, "Wow. This guy can deliver. This girl can really deliver an amazing set of values, an amazing set of knowledge, amazing content. They're going to be a big asset to my company," versus where you go to college, which course did you do? That just simply doesn't really paint a true picture, strong emphasis of why we should all be creating some sort of content. It's never too early to start, because you will suck at the beginning. You'll get better and better the more you do. As we wrap up, Todd, if people want to find you, you mentioned a whole bunch of places where you're available, what is a good place? Where should they connect with you?
TB:Obviously my website. This is one of the beautiful things. When people meet me and they say, "So what do you do?" I say, "Well I'm Todd.LIVE." They're like, "Is that your domain?"
You can make your domain your name. It can be an amazing thing, and especially if people type it on the internet somewhere and it turns that into a hotlink, even better. If you just want to chit-chat for a couple of minutes, my favorite place to do that, and where you're going to get the fast response, isTodd.LIVEon Instagram. I use Instagram private messaging like it's a text message service. There's a benefit to that. As a little tip to your audience, when you use Instagram as your text messaging service, the private messaging there, you build deep connections on Instagram and your follower count goes up. The quality of your followers goes up.
LS:We all know at least one or two creators out there that's really struggling to understand what their next step is, could really use valuable information like this, so share this episode with them and make sure we all connect. At the end of the day, we're just one big creator community. Todd, thank you very much for your time again.
TB:Thank you too Liron. It was a great pleasure to be on the show. I'll be here anytime you want.

Liron Segev:So, family vlogging has always fascinated me. It's always been one of those spaces that is seems really impossible. I mean, you've got to get the entire family involved, everybody's going to be on board, everybody's going to be producing content; and wow, it is difficult to be able to get yourself out there. You're putting your whole family on the line, essentially, for everybody to see all the madness, all the fun, sometimes the heartache as well. YouTube kind of loves this content, but only if you do it well. So, I get together with my good friend, Jason Bennett. He's literally one of my favorite YouTubers. He understands what YouTube wants, and he's going to share all this information today with us. Jason, thanks for hanging out, man.
So Jay, let's wind the clock a little bit back. Give us like a two second overview. What is your channel about, The Ohana Adventure? So, Ohana means?
Jason Bennett:It means family, and our family is all from Hawaii, and we’ve always had crazy adventures. Finally, on January 1st, 2016, we decided to start uploading some of the madness to YouTube. We have six kids, but I'm worse than the kids because I'm older and I should know better, but I still don't change the way I do.
LS:All right, so let's talk about your channel for a second with how did you get there? Look, you're doing one of those crazy, core fan starting stuff. Would other people like to see it and decided to just let you share it and see what happens?
JB:I had a skateboard channel for a couple of years, and I sponsored a YouTube event in 2015, and I started meeting with family vloggers. I had no idea what that was. So, I started talking to them and they started telling me what their income was like, what happened, and working with companies, this and that. I thought, "Honey, come here. Can I show you something?" I showed my wife a whole bunch of stuff on YouTube. I said, "I can teach you to edit, I can teach you all that. I can do all the the businessy stuff of it." Then she got started, and then I totally backed off because I wanted to see if she would keep it going or not. She blew it out of the water. She was crazy. It was amazing.
LS:So, your wife's all in? I mean, this is a whole family affair? Everybody's in, everybody is committed, everybody loves just doing this?
JB:We have family goals around the channel. We have family goals around if we can do this, we can all go do this. We try to get the kids really involved with. First, it was to pay off our debts because of some of our businesses, we had some debts leftover. So, we had a whole bunch of goals about that, and the kids were all in. It was amazing to see them like, "What can we do, what can we do to do this better? How are the views, dad?" They really were very interested in it. It was amazing.
LS:Just tell us your kids' ages, just so that we have an idea.
JB:6 almost to 16.
LS:Do you have family meetings? Do you have like a YouTube or family get togethers?
JB:We do. We have a super intense thing called Family Council, typically once a week, sometimes not that often. On Sundays, we'll actually have a little counsel, crank out the whiteboard, put down ideas, what are your ideas, what do you have this week, what's your schedule, what's our schedule, how are we going to fit these videos in? And we organize it all.
LS:So, do you have one channel? Do you have multiple channels?
JB:As a family, we have five channels, and then I have a couple of my other channels I've had for a while. I still have the skate channel. I have a fly fishing channel that's about to go crazy again. I took some time away from it, but I need to hear the rustling of the waters again. But still, I have to turn it into a business and make a channel out of it.
LS:When you guys plan like whiteboard sessions in your council sessions, so each kid basically has their own goals, their own channels?
JB:They do.
LS:How much do you kind of push them to contribute or direct them into what they should or shouldn't be doing or is a lot of that left to free choice?
JB:That's an awesome question. The oldest two, they know how to do what they do. They know how to research, they know how to look up what's working, they know how to see the channels that refer to them, pivot off of those, create their own. The two younger kids' channels, we tried to let them be in charge of the creative. It didn't work at all. My wife said, "Okay, this is now my channel until you're old enough to know what you want to do with it," even though it's still their channel. So, she's in charge of the creative. All their videos get sent to our editors because they're little kids, but they have a really nice income for little kids. I'm super jealous of my own children, but that's okay because it means that they can pay for their own wedding.
LS:How are you guys finding this? Are things going well? Do you find that you have ups and downs because of YouTube.
JB:In the beginning, we really were true vloggers, and so it was just, "Oh I'll turn on the camera, catch that, catch that. Okay, okay. Well, catch this." But then we started finding ourselves trying to add more fun stuff into our day because our day competed with every other family in the world that had a camera's day. So, we started trying to one up our own days. We tried to, "Okay, well, let's go do this today because that will make for epic content. Tomorrow, let's do this because that's going to be even better content."
That's when we came up with our hybrid because there were challenge channels that would purely just challenge themselves and others, and this, that, and the other. Then, there were the vloggers. So, we started off with our morning and something, "Here's what's going on. This, that, and the other, but we're going to play this epic game in Costco." Then, we'd finish off, "Okay, guys. Thanks for watching. If you want to see us play more games, let us know."
Then we get 10,000 comments saying "Play, more games at Costco," and so we're like, "Oh," and then we started thinking, "Well, we don't have to compete with everyone else's days. We just have to compete with everyone else who's playing this game, but those people's videos are only three minutes long. Ours are 10 minutes long. So, YouTube hopefully going to like us because we're retaining people for a lot longer." So then, we got really specific with our games, and with our placement, and with our timing.
If we lost people a little bit early and our ad placements were right before we lose them, right before a cliffhanger, then we started filming a cliffhanger three and a half minutes into the video, throw an ad right there, and then we realized that we're doing commercial breaks, but we retained people. It blew my mind.
LS:I mean, it sounds like you're very involved into analytics. You really kind of deep dive into that to understand what's working, what isn't working.
JB:You saw The Matrix, right? When he's looking at the Matrix and you see all this stuff trickling down the screen and he's like, "All I see is blonde hair, blonde hair, Brunette, this, that." I really love the new Beta Studio and I'm trying to get used to that, but the old analytics, I could really, oh, I could spend four hours and lose myself inside of them.
LS:Do you think that's a necessary skill?
JB:You have to be able to audit your own channel. If you don't know the health and wealth of your own channel, you're not going to know when you're getting sick until you're too sick to recover.
LS:You need to find a way to be you, and something that your audience is going to love you for you, and therefore, keep coming back. Keep commenting, keep watching your videos. The only way to know this is to understand what they like and give them more of that. Do you find there's a lot of kind of "Me Toos" in the blogging world or maybe on YouTube as a whole?
JB:I think all of YouTube is Me Toos. I think because of how algorithmically driven it is, if something pops, you just know that if you put something else in there that's like it, it's going to do well. We try to work that off, make conversation we had about that subject. You're like, "Hey Jase, you should try this." We try to combine trends a little bit or take a trending video.
We have this one called the Spell Book. We've got a book off Amazon, it looks all creepy. We then did four videos on the top trending subjects for our channel with this, and now these videos pop and now we can do whatever we want with these ones. So, I'm going to take this one that now pops that we created that trend of. We've got four other YouTube channels that do these Spell Book videos with us that all kill it. Now, we've got other YouTubers, "Hey, could we do one of those Spell Book videos? Hey, can we do one?" We then created a new trend, and we love doing that.
LS:As opposed to kind of doing the same as everybody else?
JB:Everyone else. Now when somebody does a video and I see 2 million views overnight, I'm going to incorporate it, change it, try to do my own thing. I'll never copy somebody else's over, but I'll try to add it in somehow so that it can benefit us, and it'll benefit them. If it is a straight up, something like that, I will totally shout out the other creator.
LS:Do you find that because everyone's playing to the algorithm, are we not kind of compromising creativity at all because we are so busy trying to understand what YouTube wants, give YouTube wanted ones, let YouTube suggest us. Doesn't it hurt creativity then?
JB:I think it absolutely does if you don't put way more of your own spin. Like our spell book thing, totally creative, but people painted green, let's say was the trend going on? Well, our Spell Book is what turned us green.
LS:Do you find that the kind of the BS meter if people like really clued, if your audience really knows you so well that they know when it's not you?
JB:Yes, ours do. Comments are disabled now, but they'll come to our Instagram. We still tell everybody to comment below, put them below on the screen, our Instagram pops up. So yes, we do have people going off platform. Hopefully, they're not doing it right then and there, and it's just the marketing seven times, seven touches, and hopefully then they're like, "You know what? I should do something on that. Let me go to their Instagram and tell them that was cool." We're getting thousands of comments on our Instagram now, which wasn't a very valid platform for us. Between our eight Instagram accounts, thousands of new followers a day right now. It's crazy how it's helping us grow.
LS:So funnyily enough, YouTube, by disabling the comments, have actually forced you to to get a Plan B. Plan B is not just blowing up another platform for you.
JB:Our main channel in the last month has got 50,000 new followers on Instagram. But the interactions are going up. So, Instagram is now liking us; the algorithms are throwing us onto the explore feed more often, so it's helping. Our channels doing better than it ever has. So, people going off platform towards Instagram isn't hurting us right now.
LS:But I think that's what makes your channels so successful. All of them, including the kids' one is because you just don't follow, you're not a Me Too channel, and that's what I've always kind of connected with; where every time it's fresh, and it's a different spin, and there's something new, and it's something that your kids and your wife and you're always very, very much into because if it's not a good fit, you'll simply walk away.
JB:Yeah, we've stopped filming 10 minutes into a video before, and just "No, let's just scratch this. This sucks. We're out. I can't tell you how many times people say, "Hey, what happened to so-and-so?" And I've commented back, "They weren't feeling it, so we let them go read a book." There just out. They're out of the video, and it's not, "You're out and we're going to take away your toys." No, it's, "Okay. You're not feeling it? You're not feeling it. That's fine." Or it's, "Let's all take a moment, and we get a drink of water.” Let's work it through and come back to it. I think our kids would have had us shut this down a long time ago if I was a drill sergeant at it.
LS:That is such an important point because even here at this event, you can see people are filming everywhere you look. These people with cameras, they're vlogging, they're filming, there's full on productions going on, and you can see some of the kids have had enough. And yet, their parents kind of, unfortunately in my opinion, keep pushing and pushing and pushing because they've got quite set of film. Whereas I see on your channel, completely the opposite; where it's more of, "Hey, are we up for this? Cool. Let's do it. Are we not? Fine, we'll do this afternoon. Let's do it.
JB:Sometimes, we do buckle down and get it down. I mean, my wife's actually phrase is, "Bennets do hard things." She's like, "Bennet's can do hard things. Let's do this." But no, if they're really not feeling it, we're done. We're out because the audience can feel it.
LS:I suppose the weekly council meeting really helps a lot. Especially, because those weekly council meetings puts people in focus of what's expected this week.
JB:Before we started YouTube, we had four different businesses. Two were retail, one was manufacturing, one was real estate. We were trying to do anything we could to get out of this debt one of our earlier businesses had. We’re a Christian family and prayed to get out of debt. Our kids are fully vested into what we do because they've always been a part of our businesses. Our retail store, Clay was our oldest, was six months old sitting in one of those bouncy things next to the register in our first retail store. They've always been involved.
LS:Do you think that kind of having that transparency and openness helped kind of shape who they are?
JB:It has definitely shaped who they are and there have been long, hard conversations with my wife and I into how much do we let them know. Do we let them know what we're earning? Do we not let them know what we're earning? Well, if they know we're earning, that's going to totally mess up their minds' on what money is, and this and that. So, this is a hot topic between us because me, it's like, "Let them know."
They knew when we were $30,000 in the hole and we were trying to get out of it. Why not let them know how out of the hole we are now and how hard we're working for it? Actually, there was a story, real quick, in IKEA, checking out and I was filming it and I had told my daughter, I said, "Look at this lady. She's in her sixties, she's working at IKEA, she has to be there at this time, she gets these moments for breaks, she gets to leave at this time, and I'm sure she has grandkids, she has all that, but she doesn't have the freedom to go and do what she wants because of the choices she's made that led her to this point."
My wife elbowed me really hard and said, "That's being so mean." I said, "It's just being real." Like, we were $30,000 in debt. I was working my butt off, I was stressed out, there were tears, there were arguments. All of our decisions had led up to that moment and it was our fault. Nobody else did that to us. It was all of our decisions that led to that. I said, "So this lady," and so we were checking out and my daughter was looking at her, this is when she was deciding if she's going to start a YouTube channel or not, and she looked at the lady and the lady said, "Why are you filming this?"
I said, "Oh, I wasn't getting you on camera. I was just filming the stuff. Go through the check, it's good B-roll." She goes, "I know. Why are you filming this?" "So, it's for our YouTube channel." She goes, "Can I ask why you do that?" I said, "Because it paid off all of our family's debts while we played together on camera," and she said, "Man, I wish I would've done something like that because then I wouldn't be here," and my daughter's jaw dropped.
The lady heard her and she's like, "What did you say?" I just said, "No, just all of our choices lead to certain things," I said, "and what I meant by that is we should look at the end from the beginning, and look at the end and go, 'I want to be there. How do I get there? What choices am I going to make that take me there?'"
So, our family channel will create these little trends hoping that if we can get this one to hit, then we can have this one a month later, get this one to hit, so we can start doing this kind of content. Because we did all those parodies, we were a teen channel. Teens don't have a lot of runway. Right? After about a year of a teen, they then get their license and you've lost your subscriber.
If you can get eight year olds, they're very engaged, they're very active, the algorithm loves it. You've got them until they're 14 or 15. So, it took us two years to age down our channel. It was working wonderfully, but we knew it didn't have a lot of runway with it even aging down our channel for two years, and it has been painful. All of our friends' channels blowing up. They're about a million subscribers ahead of us. Now finally, we are now just rocketing. It's doing amazing.
In our YouTube life, we don't want to be at the check stand in our sixties. We want all these brand deals and all this stuff, and so what we're doing now is kids' content. We started all our new kids channels. Now, we have an agreement with our children with percentages and everything, is that maybe in the next couple of years, we can stop ours and their channels are all going. So, we can calm it down, they can keep going, and everybody's still happy.
LS:Yeah. Because again, they've got the energy, they've got the time, and they've got all of those. You still have your other priorities, other things that you want to do. You don't want to be locked into this vicious cycle, and we've seen that with a lot of YouTubers where it became a job and they cannot get off this wheel. It's the same as having a regular job in a regular firm. Well, you still can't get off the wheel.
JB:Yup. What's your end game? But, the checks were still great. We just knew what they could be once we got that more targeted audience that would watch through more ads that had the time to chill.
LS:Well, okay. That's a great lesson. It's more of a short term yes, and the numbers are great, and the ad check that comes through is amazing. Is this going to last forever? That's the question; and darn, we know it's not.
JB:None of us are getting out of here alive, and no businesses get out of here alive. Like, they all transition whether they're acquired, they're merged, they're something. I talk a lot at business conferences, and nothing I say is very popular. This is a very unpopular one, and I say there's a difference between business owners and entrepreneurs. A business owner owns a business. An entrepreneur starts a business with the intent of something. So, you can do another one and then another, whatever it is. These YouTubers, what is your purpose? Why did you start this? Because once you stop, you've got about a year until those checks go back down to zero. When you stop, what is your end game? Do you want to get into TV? Do you want to get into a radio? Do you want to become a model? Do you want to do feature films? So, ours is, we wanted to create this for our kids, and so we've created all their channels. We're going to grow theirs, and then we can back off, and they can drive the train.
LS:What has got you really excited right now?
JB:The wow is all the YouTubers that I am speaking with right now about creating product lines, legit product lines. Like me helping other YouTubers create physical products that their audience is dying to swipe a card for, that has gotten me pumped. I know that's out of my channel. That's just what I'm so pumped about right now. Here, I'll say it differently. I'm pumped that YouTubers are becoming entrepreneurs, not just artists.
LS:Do you think people are finally getting the message that it's more than just the platform, it's more than just an audience?
JB:Yes. If you'd have asked me eight months ago, I would've said no. Honestly, as recently as the last eight months, because my email's off the hook from all these different YouTubers I've never even met saying, "Hey, I hear you're the guy to talk to. I've got this widget that I need to make." It's not just, "Hey, can you do hoodies and shirts for me?" It's, "I've got this character on my channel, I need it to be in people's homes now, not just on their screens." That gets me so pumped.
LS:Wow. Do you find that's happening more and more and more?
JB:So much more. Even our own channel. My daughter just got back from a trip to China with me making her jewelry line and her hair accessories line. The stuff on our site is, even though we're not pushing our products, we're selling tons of phone cases, and tote bags, and adventure bags, and all this other stuff. So, I think it's amazing where it's going right now. I'm so excited. My thing is, become your own brand. Brand deals are wonderful with other companies, but if you can become your own brand, do a couple of brand deals to fund your own. Specifically, take that money, don't touch it, and make sure it goes into investing into your own entrepreneurial venture, into you.
LS:Wow. Okay, so if you have a YouTube channel, stop thinking, "Adsense, Adsense, Adsense only." Could you test this? I mean, could you do a small run of something?
JB:100%. With YouTube's little Teespring banner at the bottom, take your three favorite designs, a couple of colors, put it on there. After a month, a week, whatever, until you get at least a hundred sales. Then whatever sold the most, physically make that because you will make 500% more making it yourself than just print on demanding it through anybody else. It's not a risk anymore. You have the data to look at and go, "Oh the pink shirt is the shirt.
LS:So, use Teespring, use the platform that you have because you've got the tools, give it a bash, and see what happens.
JB:Shopify sites have four different print on demand companies that you can test out. If it works, awesome, then do it for real. Don't make a dollar or $2 a shirt, make $11.
LS:In the last six months, eight months, ten months, what's something that's nice and cheap that made you really happy?
JB:A meal with one of my kids, just a lone meal with one of my kids. We call them just a date. Honestly, that's what I live for.
LS:Doesn't that just embody your whole channel? I mean, that's just your channel, your family values.
JB:I hope so. We're trying to share that big families can have a blast. Everyone sees us come to the airport and literally, I'm Moses - I part the waters and everybody moves like, "Oh my gosh, look at that family. Oh, my gosh, I can't believe they are ruining the planet and all this stuff." That was our goal in the beginning, was just to show that big families have fun, big families are cool, big families are a party.
LS:I must say, that is one thing I really love about Jason and kind of his family and what they do. It's just what you see is what you get. Everything's above board, everything is just as good and wholesome as can be. There isn't this whole fakeness of, "Oh, I'm a TV star. I'm a celebrity." And to be clear, they get mobbed by hundreds of people when they go to a Vidcon or something like that. They don't believe the right PR, so to speak.
LS:As far as that goes, they'll hang out with anyone. Jason will often walk up to someone and say, "Hey, what do you do?" Not, "What is your channel size"? Therefore, I'm willing to talk to you. That is never been kind of your style at all. Do you find that really makes you kind of unique and kind of stand out? Because let's be honest, this is a bit of a world all about numbers.
JB:I know everyone's numbers. I have my app and I scroll everyone's numbers every day. Too many times seeing where it's all at. But since where am I, I mean, I don't care. The algorithm loves you this month. It's gonna love meeting next month. It's gonna love them the month after that. So what?
LS:There's enough to go around. This is kind of the big thing, is that YouTube views are finite. In other words, we don't get a thousand views a day and now we have to decide who to distribute them to. I can watch 10 of Jason's videos and 10 of somebody else's videos, and everybody gets a view. We don't take away of you from someone because you've watched somebody else's. So, who cares about the number? Are you a good person? Do I want to hang out with you? Do we get along?
Those to me are much more important. And by the way, when you do those collabs, those are much more organic. The audience loves those because now you're collaborating with other people. What are some good tips for us to grow a channel?
JB:Work with other creators, small, big whatever. But we've had people on our channel that had 2 million subscribers less than us and we collaborated with them. They had a great idea. So, let's do it. That's going to be fun. It's going to be real, so let's do it. But, don't come up to me and say, "Hey your channel's huge, let's collab." There's nothing there. Say "Hey Jase, my name's so-and-so. I've got this epic idea. Your family would be perfect. Do you guys want to go and do this weird thing on the staircase that's this, this, that, and the other?" Sure. I didn't look at my phone, I didn't see how big their channel was. I didn't care. That sounds like an awesome idea, it's your idea. Let's do it.
LS:Brilliant. If more and more people took that attitude that YouTube will be a different space as a whole.
JB:I think it would be. Because I've gotten up and said hey to them and they like, I don't know. It's interesting. They do have more subs, but they're getting half the daily views. So, which is more relevant? If you have 3 million subscribers and there's a guy with 500,000, but his last four videos were a hundred percent viewership and you're at 10% right now. Right? 2 million channel, you're getting 200,000 views. He's got a more active audience. Do something, he'd be stoked to work with you because you look bigger. You should be stoked with them because they've got the more relevant active audience.
LS:All right. So, as we wrap up, if you could have one message on a tweet or an a video that everybody would watch, what would be that message?
JB:Man, I'm all just about be real. Honestly, just be real. If you've got an issue with me, come and tell me my hair sucks. I am totally okay with that. Then, allow me to tell you that your ear lobes are super weird, you know? But, that's okay. We can hug it out, and move on, and then become friends. I don't know. I just love, I respect people that are real so much because real isn't popular.

Why Super Fans Can Get You More YouTube Views: Full Transcript
Pat Flynn:I'm excited to be on TubeTalk. Thank you for having me, and you know, listening to that sort of list of stuff, I'm like, "Wow, maybe I'm doing too much." I don't know.
Liron Segev:No, this is only the stuff I could remember. I mean, Smart Passive Income really got my attention. When did you make the move, thinking, "Oh, I need to teach this stuff. I need to share this stuff. I need to do something with content." What was that thought like?
PF:Yeah, it was actually out of a successful online business that I created any architecture space. I actually went to school for architecture, thought I was going to be a lifelong architect and those were my dreams, and then in 2008, I was laid off from a very good job that I actually loved and I had no idea what I was going to do next.
I got involved with a group of people who had a podcast, actually, who had some courses and some good knowledge to share to help people who were sort of aspiring entrepreneurs, and I decided to take some knowledge I had about an exam that I took called the LEED Exam. Very, very specific, very little tiny world of the architecture space, but it was an exam that I took that I knew was very difficult, and I also knew there wasn't much out there in terms of support.
So I decided to create a website and help people. I spent maybe 12 to 16 hours a day, sometimes even more, not just putting blog content on my website, but also being involved in forums and talking to people and just answering questions. And, little did I know, I was becoming this sort of go-to person in that space and I launched a study guide. I sold it for $19, and it was just through a simple PayPal sort of thing and another tool called E-junkie that would allow a person to have it be delivered to them via email after purchase. In that first month after launching at the end of 2008, I had made $7.908.55 from a $19 ebook.
And I was just like, "Wow, this is like ..." First of all, I thought the FBI was going to come and break down my doors because it just didn't seem ... Like, how did this even happen? Google picked up on my website. A lot of people started to share it and it just became the go-to resource, and so it was after that success and seeing that I was making more money doing this than I was with architecture, I was like, "Oh, I got to share this." So I started smartpassiveincome.com to show people how this all happened and what I learn and what I wish I did differently.
Then over time, I started to build new businesses. A lot of them you mentioned, and just sharing the entire process along the way. I also did something that was ... I wasn't the first to do this, but I was, I think, one of the most well known, is I shared exactly how much money I was making and exactly where it was coming from in each of these businesses, which inspired a lot of people, and now, like you said, I do a lot of keynote speeches. I've written books before, self-published but still bestsellers, and I have this new one coming out and I'm just so blessed to have the opportunity to help more people and pay it forward, which is really where all this is coming from.
The reason it's called Smart Passive Income, and the passive income part is because even though that's the last step of the process, like I always am upfront with people and say, "You know, this business stuff is not easy. It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of failures and mistakes, but the whole reason to do it is because you can get some time back. You can build these businesses and invest that time upfront so that these things can start working for you instead of the other way around.
You know, I have two kids and I can spend most of my time with them. I have a team who helps me run the businesses and just allows me to do a lot of fun things like this new invention or write books and be on your show and all that cool stuff. So, that's kind of how we got to where we are today.
LS:So we could kind of jump a little bit on something that's close to my heart, personally. It's that SwitchPod, and I just want to touch on that for a simple reason that it's physical. Everything else that you've done has been online, has been a downloadable course. You've got a podcasting course, you've got affiliate marketing ... I mean, you've got all of those online courses and now you've gone physical. How did that happen?
PF:So, my buddy Caleb and I (Caleb is my videographer for my YouTube videos and my courses), and we attended VidSummit in Los Angeles and we were invited to go, and it was a great conference, but we noticed one thing that was really interesting while we were there is that everybody had these GorillaPods. A lot of you are very familiar with the GorillaPod, I'm sure, and it's an amazing tool.
It's a tripod that has flexible legs that can wrap around poles and trees and allow you to do a bunch of things. And we just thought it was kind of interesting because, you know, vlogging has sort of picked up steam and Casey Neistat and Peter McKinnon helped push that forward and they sort of ... The GorillaPod has become the vlogger's tool for sort of bending it in a way such that your camera's a little bit further away. You get that wider angle view and it's somewhat portable, but it was really interesting because we were there and everybody had them, but everybody was struggling with them.
Like, kind of opening them, closing them, bending them to the right position and then reopening them again to put them down. And we were like, "Wow, there's got to be a better way. Like, nobody's invented something to help these people?"
So we did research and all we found was just people upset at their GorillaPod for this solution that it actually wasn't built for. So, right at this moment, another person came by who I had interviewed on my podcast. His name is Richie Norton from a company called Prouduct, and it just must have been fate or something, because his company helps entrepreneurs take ideas for physical products and actually make them happen.
And so, Caleb and I were like, "Richie, come here, we just noticed this thing and we have this idea. What do you think of this tripod that does this instead, and it's built for vloggers specifically and it doesn't bend around poles and trees, because I've never done that, and most people we talk to don't ever use that capability?" And he was like, "Let's do it, let's build it." And we were like, "Wait, really? Let's actually do it?" Because I can't tell you how many times I've come up with ideas just on the go and I'm like, "Oh, it'd be cool to do that, but nah, I'm not qualified" or "Nah, I don't know even how to get started."
And he's like, "Just cut out cardboard. Just start, just start." Just do something to get your hands onto something to get you to the idea of like, "Okay, well, what might this thing look like? How might it work?"
And over time, you know, a couple months went by, we had cut out things in cardboard and we sent our drawings and sketches to his team, and his engineer, Cole, gave us a CAD drawing of something that seemed like it would kind of be cool. And we're like, "Okay, where do we go from here?" And he's like, "You know what? There's these places all around the world that you can go to now and give them your CAD file, and they can 3D print that in plastic so you can actually get a feel for it." And we're like, "Okay."
So, a couple of weeks go by and we get this shipment, and it's our first working prototype. And the way the SwitchPod works, it just ... I know everybody's listening to this right now, but if you imagine the legs of a tripod, if you fold the legs into each other to create one sort of handle and it has like grips for your hands. That's how it works, and then you can unfold it back into tripod mode.
I mean, this thing, people saw the Kickstarter campaign earlier this year and it made over a half million dollars, or just about a half million dollars, about 5,000 backers, and thank you for being one of them. And people go, "Wow, that took off so fast," but I mean, people don't hear about the story behind it, which was like six months of prototyping and failures, but here's the thing that worked the best.
We found a problem, and in this little world of vlogging, it's a big problem because the GorillaPod's hard to travel with. It's not as easy to work with. Some people who aren't vloggers, they see the SwitchPod and they're like, "That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Why would I use that?" And we're like, "You wouldn't use it. Go get a GorillaPod because you actually do wrap things around trees," but for people who specifically are vloggers who want to open and close their tripod, this is the solution they've been waiting for. And it's only that because throughout the entire process we would build something that wasn't fully working yet or to what we thought it would be, and we shared it.
We went to conferences like VidCon, and VidSummit again a year later, and many other places where YouTubers existed, and we just handed it to people and go, "What do you think?" And we just watched them play with it and we would watch their reaction and we'd ask them questions like, "Would this be useful to you? How much would you pay for it? Would you travel with this?" They created it for us to create back for them. You know? And that's how it became the perfect solution for vloggers and why it's just getting so much buzz right now.
And it's really cool because now even retailers have come onboard to want to get their hands on it as well. B&H Photo has it, Adorama has it, and it's just like, "How did we, like without any experience doing a physical product before, how did we do this?" We did it because we, number one, connected with the right people who knew how to do it, and that's I think a big thing that a lot of people who want to start something, they go, "Oh, I don't know how to do this," or "I can't do it."
Well guess what? There's people out there who spent years trying to figure this out who can help you and get it done faster for you. Some of them put their content online, some of them put their content in books. Some of them are resources that you could connect with in person, and that's exactly what we did. And then the prototyping phase, trial and error, keep going. Trial, error, keep going. Trial, error, keep going. And that's the same pattern I use for my digital products.
It's a little bit longer in the physical product space, and I'll tell you, this project, the SwitchPod, made me appreciate way more all the stuff in digital for sure.
LS:What I do love about your two stories here, and the trend that I've picked up with you, is that you've always identified a niche. So you went after a problem. So with the GorillaPod and vloggers, that was a problem and it was a limited problem. It was only limited to that community, but same as your architectural exam issue, it was limited to a certain small community, but it was still a problem that they were having and they'll continuously have. So vloggers are going to continuously having issues with their GorillaPod.
90% of us who use the GorillaPod never have wrapped it around anything, but the idea of being able to have something that's slick and quick and I can just open it and close it, that's sold. So you've identified the problem, you've spoken to the consumer who's going to be actually using the product, ultimately, and therefore, they have led you on that design route to get you through the end results. Cannot love this even more if I tried.
PF:You said it better than I could.
LS:All right, so now you've got the physical product, you've got these courses going, and then now you're thinking, "It's time for yet another book." So what inspired this idea that now is the time to get this thing done?
PF:mean, there's a lot of things. It's a bunch of things happening all at once that inspired me to write this, and it ties back into my architecture website, but also where we are now in social media, especially on YouTube. You have subscribers, you have followers, even people who hit that bell icon, yet they're not able to see you. It's kind of ridiculous how much, even though we have fans and followers, we're still not able to reach everybody.
But the truth is, if a person loves you so much and is just obsessed with what you do in your art, in your creations, no matter what they're going to take time to go and consume whatever it is that you have and even become a customer, or a repeat customer. This is where the idea of super fans comes into play. And this really comes from where I think businesses should be focusing nowadays because technology's changing, social media is changing, but the truth is, no matter what happens in technology, you're super fans are people who just love you and what you do. They're going to be with you no matter what happens and this is how you build a future-proof business.
As much as people are worried about search engine optimization on YouTube and Google and paying for ads and getting in front of new audiences, that's all fine, but what happens when people finally get there? We're not focusing on how we can provide those experiences once people come to us and find us to elevate them into superfan status so that they can, not only become fans of ours and repeat customers and ambassadors for our brand, but through that they're going to grow our brand for us from the inside out, and bring new people in with their recommendation, which is going to be much stronger than you paying for ads for somebody cold who doesn't know who you are to try and convince them to come into your brand. So, when you build for super fans, your brand will grow on its own.
It reminds me of back in the architecture website, which is still alive today. I honestly spend maybe two hours, three hours a year just making sure it's fine. It's kind of ridiculous and it still makes a few thousand dollars a month now. But, when I was first starting out in 2009, after a couple months of success with that website, I got an email from a woman. Her name is Jackie, and she was just like raving about how the prep guide that I created helped her.
She's like, "I've studying for years and I couldn't pass this exam. It was just like a knife on my back every time. I couldn't get rid of it and finally I found your guide and I passed in two weeks. Thank you. Can I take you and your family out to dinner? Can we go to Disneyland together? You helped me get a promotion and all this stuff." And it was just like, "Wow, this is incredible that I'm able to help somebody this much with just passing an exam," but then at the end of her email, she was like, "I'm a huge fan, Jackie." And I was like, "A huge fan? How could you be a fan? All I did was help you pass an exam. Like, you're a fan of me? Okay."
I just kind of let it go until a couple months later I checked my customer list and I found out that there were like 35 different customers who all had the same sort of end of an email address like hers. They were from the same company and she apparently told her boss and convinced everybody in her office to buy my guide too. And it's just like that one person who got a little bit of help and extra attention to help her with her major problem in this little world of the LEED exam, like you were talking about earlier, she then went on to help spread the word and get me 35 more customers.
She could have easily just been like, "Hey, everybody, get my ebook that I bought and you don't have to pay anything," but she made sure that I got rewarded for that. And just imagine if you had just a 100 Jackies in your YouTube?
This takes me to an article that was written by a man named Kevin Kelly. I often recommend this as required reading for anybody, any entrepreneur, creator, because Kevin Kelly wrote this article called a1,000 True Fansand when we talk about how big do we need to grow? If you just have a 1,000 true fans, those fans who are going to watch every single video even if they don't get notified for it. They're going to travel eight hours to hang out with you at a little meetup that you put together. Those are your super fans.
If you imagine they pay you $100 a year for whatever your craft is, which isn't very much, that's less than $10 a month. Maybe they're on Patreon but $100 a year times a 1,000 true fans. There's your six-figure business right there and just shows you that you don't have to create a blockbuster hit to have some amazing success.
That ties directly and perfectly into what you said earlier about, you know, I'm not building something that changes the entire world. The LEED exam, like most people don't even know about. The SwitchPod, like most people in this world couldn't care less about it, but for those little micro-worlds where that thing is solving their problem, that's everything to them. And because of that, you're able to stand out to reach them more, you're able to have less competition, and then from there you can even branch out.
And if I was smarter and had more confidence back with my architecture website, I would've then created the next steps. I never did that. Like, after you pass this exam here, now take these tests, now take these tests, and I didn't do that. But I wouldn't have had the opportunity if I didn't start small.
LS:And it wasn't about numbers. And I think that's kind of the big misconception is that people from the outside look at this YouTube world of ours. They're looking at where we're living ... and it's all a numbers game. You know, you can only make money when you get a million subscribers. And that's all nonsense. I mean, I did my first brand deal with Samsung. Gosh, back in the day, I had less than a 1,000 subscribers on YouTube, but I could offer them value. I could give them a return on their investment. I can help them with their funnels.
They weren't buying me, they were buying access to my audience, which listened to what I had to say. But as soon as you realize that, then the numbers are irrelevant because a blog could have a 100 views or a YouTube channel could have a 100 views on a video, but if those 100 people, like clicking on that affiliate link, and they're buying your stuff, that's more than the AdSense is going to pay until you get to your AdSense. But, stop focusing on that $4.95 on AdSense, focus on building a brand, building a business. Everything else will come. Right?
PF:Even if it was one person of that 100 who paid for a coaching program, I mean, that's going to be months of AdSense right there perhaps. Did you hear that story about that Instagramer? She had two million followers on Instagram and she was selling a T-shirt and she only sold 26, and she was really upset about it. It kind of went viral and it's just like, "I bet you there's some people with 26 followers who could sell a hundred shirts."
LS:Completely. One of our previous episodes here is with a company called Crowdmade and they supply some of the largest YouTubers with their merch, and he was saying exactly the same thing. It's amazing how many six-figure YouTube subscribers who've got millions of subscribers cannot sell merchandise because they haven't made that connection with their audience. But smaller YouTubers have made such a great community they hang on to every one of their words. When they say go buy this, they do. So, it's not the size.
Do you find that there's a line somewhere between oversharing, but oversharing in terms of giving away too much on an open platform, and then when you want to sell somebody a course, it becomes a bit of a harder challenge?
PF:I don't. And there's an argument here obviously, because if you share the whole thing then why would people pay to get kind of the same thing? But they wouldn't, they're almost paying you back for all the value that you've given them. And if you build super fans, they're going to feel bad if they aren't supporting you. Right? And that's not why you build super fans to make people feel bad, but, it's a byproduct.
If you look up how to start a podcast on YouTube, I'm number one, currently, which is really cool, but I also sell a podcasting course, which discusses a lot of the same things, but I do go into a little bit more detail but I also offer office hours every week for all my students. You know, where there's customer support and you can get your questions answered in a Facebook group, and there's community and accountability there. But even though it's like the same material, people go through that and they go, "Wow, I've gotten so much here, I'd love to join the community and let me buy your course for 100's of dollars. But whenever they share it, they might share either, but either way, people are getting to see my style.
And I think, yes, you could argue again, "Oh, you want to give away 80% of it and then leave the 20% sort of behind a paywall," and that just never sits right with me because then you're doing it for the wrong purpose. For me, if your whole goal is to make money, you're already going to lose.
Your whole goal should be to serve people so well they can't help but want to pay you for it. But, of course, a lot of people serve people really well and aren't getting paid anything, and I think that's where marketing has to come into play. A lot of people see me give away everything and other people give away everything too, but then they don't have opportunities for people to pay them back. They don't put affiliate links in there. They don't have the courage to ask for people to pay for things when it's worth paying for because they're scared. And that's a whole other topic and conversation about, you know, the fact that you can serve and sell, or sell and serve at the exact same time.
I want to give so much and it's always come back to me in some way, shape or form. Even if it's not a direct monetary giveback. Sometimes it's a recommendation to somebody who could influence the business in some way or just, you know, a testimonial or just a thank you, even. And that goes a long way.
LS:Circles back to building that tribe. How important is that for us, as YouTubers, as creators or perhaps maybe we're still blogging, which I am, I don't think blogging is dead yet, but how important is that for us to kind of build that community, that tribe?
PF:I mean, it's everything. It's an insurance policy. It is your connection to who it is that you serve. It is where you will understand what you should be doing next, what videos to create, what products to create. That all comes from the people that you're serving. If you ever tried to build a business on your own and you're hiding behind your keyboard and you're not talking and having conversations and doing research on what those problems are, well then you're just guessing. And when you have that community, you no longer have to guess.
Not only that, you're going to understand exactly who you are building or creating for and your material will be that much more real. It'll be that much more authentic. It'll be that much more just on the nose for what those people need and will position you more as an authority, as an expert and gets those people to be confident enough to share you with their friends and family and other communities who also have the same problems that they know you an expert for. And it just kind of snowballs from there, which is really great.
The truth about it is that, you know, when you're trying to build a community and generate super fans ... I mean, they're not created overnight. You don't listen to a song and then immediately you're a fan of that band for the first time after you listened to the song. It takes many moments. It takes multiple listens of that song and digging into their album and then going to the concert and then getting into the VIP area and then going backstage and then getting a handshake and then maybe they say your name and "Oh my God, now you're a fan" and you have all the action figures and bobbleheads related to that person, or whatever. Right?
It's moments over time and this is why a lot of people are only focusing on those initial moments and even failing in that, but not like, "Okay, how do we bring them up into the community? How do we make them feel like they belong? How do we give them a voice? How do we make them want to continue to stick around and speak to each other and find each other?" Because once people find their people, I mean, you know the communities and groups stick together based on similar interests and you are the facilitator. You are the group owner, you are the YouTuber. The person who has that power to do that and many people are just not even seeing the opportunities that are right in front of them.
LS:Pat Flynn style, step-by-step. Let me hold your hand and walk you through this process.
PF:It is literally that. That's my style and it's easy, but it's powerful, and it's something that I am so behind right now in terms of all businesses, whether you are a sole YouTuber, just sharing your little makeup lines that you buy at Walmart on video and you just have a couple 100 subscribers, or maybe you are the owner of a Fortune 500 company.
It's so important to build for these fans and create these experiences and this book will go from the moment people find you, how do you trigger them to come into your brand and be an active subscriber in some way, shape or form? And then, having them become an active subscriber, because just because you're a subscriber doesn't mean you're playing the game, right?
The analogy I like to use is when I was a kid, I was very short. I was five feet tall my senior year of high school. So, I was a shrimp. But, my friends were taller and they all play basketball. So, they were nice, they invited me to play with them, but I was always last picked and I never got past the ball and I never got to shoot the ball. Therefore, even though I was on the court, I never felt like I was on the team.
And, as a business, as a creator, you need to make people feel like they're a part of the team, right? Allowing them to get the ball every once in a while. To have a voice, to have a say in the direction or to be able to speak up and be seen and be heard. And then from there, there's a lot of things that I think a lot of people are losing the opportunities down on to go from the community to then become a super fan.
And sometimes the community, naturally people will become a super fan, but there's a lot of things you can do in there to make people feel really special and to have them really grasp a hold of you and what you do. I mean, I'm at a point now in my business where I can tweet or share a Facebook message that I'm going to be at a restaurant somewhere and I'd love to meet people and then all of a sudden there's been like a 100 people there, and it's just ridiculous.
And I'm just a regular person. Right? And like in this little small space. The same thing was happening with my architecture website. The same thing's happening with the SwitchPod now in video space, which I wasn't totally a part of before. But man, and like we all have that capability and it's just, you know, I think people just need a little bit of direction and that's what I'm here for.
LS:And it is a step-by-step. So, whether you have a small audience or like virtually no audience, is that still a good time to kind of pick this up and maybe set yourself up for success?
PF:Oh, 100%. I mean, you're going to be way ahead of the game on your competition or your future competition because they're not going to be doing these things. And I think the other part about this is because it's not so centric on keyword research and SEO, which of course, like I said, are still important, but it's fun. This building of super fans is so much fun and it adds a lot more flavor into the business from your end. And when you're having fun, guess what? Your audience, your viewers, your subscribers are going to have fun. Your community's going to have fun, and it's a win for everybody.
So, I just appreciate you allowing me to share this and, as you can tell, I get really excited about the topic and it's because I've experienced it myself and nothing I share isn't from ... Everything I share comes from my own experience, and it's because I'm just continuing to pay it forward for all the blessings that I've had in my life with, you know ... and I think about getting laid off and honestly it was probably the best thing that could ever happen to me.
LS:Crazy. As we kind of wrapping up with this, obviously we'll have links to everything in the show notes, so nobody will miss a thing. If you could put one message out into the world, be it a tweet that the entire world will see, or a billboard in New York Square, what would that message be?
PF:Your earnings are a byproduct of how well you serve your audience, and if I could have a little sort of symbol underneath it would read "serve first" and that's what I live by. That's what has helped me become successful and that's what I teach others, is to serve first because you will be rewarded. Nobody's ever been poor by helping others.
LS:Well, there we go. That was very, very powerful. I've got a bit of goosebumps. I'm not going to lie. Okay, that was awesome. Pat, what have you got going on? Obviously, you've got the book going on, let us know where we can find you. What's the best way to stalk you online?
PF:Yeah, no, thank you. So I'm @PatFlynn on most places online, including on YouTube as well. But if you would like to get your hands on super fans ... If you happen to hear this before August 13th, which is the launch date, you can pre-order it and submit your receipt at yoursuper fans.com and if you do that, I'm going to give you the audio book for free. So again, that's yoursuper fans.com, just put your receipt there. You can pre-order on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and even Target as well. It doesn't matter where. Just submit your receipt at yoursuper fans.com before August 13th and thank you again for all the support for that. And then my main website at smartpassiveincome.com.
The other thing with the SwitchPod like we talked about, which may be of interest to your audience after discussing that today, and again, thank you for allowing me to share that story. It's always fun to think about how long and crazy this journey has been. But switchpod.co is where you can see it and check it out and it's going to get in people's hands ... It's going to get in your hands by end of August as we promised, or early September if everything else goes to plan.
So, by then it'll be available with additional inventory that we have but for right now it's still available for pre-order on Shopify on our website at switchpod.co but our backers are going to get at first because they deserve it.
LS:I am definitely a superfan. Definitely excited to get the book and also extremely excited to get my hand on that SwitchPod. Pat, thank you very much for your time.

3 Skills Every Creator Needs to Get More Views on YouTube : Brian G Johnson TubeTalk 168
Let me ask you this question. If you look at your YouTube channel, are you as good or better than the top 1% of YouTubers out there? Sadly, for most of us, the answer is no, and yet we expect the same results that they get - the same number of subs, and the same number of views.
Of course, those big numbers are simply unrealistic for many small YouTube channels. So, do we just give up? Do we lose all hope, or is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Today we're going to get real, but we've also got some real practical answers of what you need to do.
This week's episode of TubeTalk, the YouTubers podcast, is all about understanding what you're doing right and what you're doing wrong and developing the three big skills that anyone serious about YouTube needs. I’m joined by Brian G. Johnson, a passionate entrepreneur whose mission is to help others to not just share their message, but to amplify it by leveraging the power of video.

In this podcast you will learn the major skills you need to compete with the most successful YouTube channels:

3 Skills Every Creator Needs to Get More Views on YouTube: Full Transcript
Liron Segev:Welcome to TubeTalk Brian
Brian G Johnson:YouTube is so amazing, it's really challenging, but I'm confident that in the next few minutes, we can talk and share some ideas that can help people really move the needle on their YouTube channel.
LS:And that's what we're all about here on Tube Talk. There's so many of us that are struggling. We're kind of trying to find our focus, trying to find our footing, and there are still YouTubers with millions of subscribers and we're having the same conversations with them because they're also still struggling. Are we going to struggle for ever?
BGJ:We all have this opportunity to decide that we're going to move forward and get really tremendous results with our YouTube channel. It's not always easy, it doesn't always happen on our timeline, however, when you decide that you're going to move forward, and you're going to do the thing that you want to do, I guarantee you from that moment on you're going to be just a little bit closer to achieving the results you're after.
The first step is to decide it shall be. Stake your claim and make it happen. The second part is to start acting like your life depended on it. And that doesn't mean simply uploading videos. And if we look at the results, statistically speaking, so many YouTubers upload video after video, but they have zero results. Stagnant channel growth. They actually lose subscribers, struggle with ranks, struggle to show up in suggested, nothing seems to work.
LS:So, is this because we're just a slave to the YouTube algorithm, and it doesn't matter what we do? Or are we just doing the wrong things?
BGJ:Well, at the end of the day, there's no question that as YouTubers, we watch the very best YouTubers on the planet. We get accustomed to those kinds of results. And I think the sooner we can really understand, on a deep level, that the YouTube algorithm does follows the audience. And when we get in tune with what our audience is, we're going to have just a little bit better of a chance to move forward and really generate the results. So as we move forward, I think it's really important we talk about what the audience is and then break down some tactical elements that I've leveraged, steps to really improve my results.
LS:Well, you've opened this door, we're going to walk through it. Where do we begin?
BGJ:So, first off, I think it's so very important to really embrace the idea of testing. And I want to ask you, the viewer, right now, can you really tell me that you're really testing your thumbnail? Do your thumbnails look different? Are they based on the different colors? Are they based on with a picture of you in them or not? Do you make thumbnails that are exciting or how is it that you're really changing up the game? And I think this is something we can hear, but oftentimes we struggle to really implement and change things up. And the first thing I want to share Liron is, it's just so very important that we do make considerable changes to what we do day to day, and we experiment.
LS:So is experimenting actually healthy for your channel?
BGJ:If you're not growing, what's the worst that could happen? Nothing. You already have nothing. You may say but I've got a couple of subscribers and they really like what I'm doing. Well, if you want to grow to 100 thousand subscribers, but you're being held captive by two people that love your content, you're doing yourself and the audience you want to obtain, a disservice. So it's really important just to say hey, you know, I'm going to mix it up, I'm going to try some different things.
LS:So many people say exactly what you've just said. I've got a handful of people, they love my content, I'm just going to do more for them. Well, that's fine, but then that's your channel for five people.
BGJ:When you decide the thing that you really want is growth, then you have to start making growth decisions. One of the things I did was, I took a break for a few months. And I came back in January, and I really tried to change things up with my thumbnails, and I can look at my thumbnails today in the middle of May, and I've literally come up with about four very, very different designs.
Some of the times, I've got my face in the thumbnails. Other times, I don't. Some of the times, I'm using yellow and red, other times I use green and really a dark kind of inky blue-black. And again, the reason I'm doing this is because number one, I think when you really deliver on what the audience loves, when it's about them, you don't have to worry about, well I've got a brand, and my color's orange. Well, okay great. But if you've got nothing, maybe it's okay to experiment. Maybe you don't have to held captive again by branding. Or, I use this font, or but this is how I do it. And this kind of thinking has really allowed me to uncover some new styles that are still a part of my brand. No one said, oh, you lost your brand.
LS:I love your thumbnails. When I see your thumbnails, I don't even have to read the text, I can see that illuminous green coming at me a mile away. I know that's your video instantly, and I make that connection. As the famous saying goes, if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten. So, if you're always going to do what you did yesterday, well don't expect different results today.
BGJ:And this is where we're talking about experimenting. So, here's what's up, I came back from a long break. It was January, I was excited to hit it, and the thing I did was I really tried things that were new, and they were different. And that's, as a human being, it's hard to push the envelope like that. It's hard to push the needle to go outside of the things we've gotten accustomed to, but it's just really important to do that. And I would encourage you, go to my channel and look at how I've really varied my thumbnails, and my style over time. And it's not just the thumbnails, Liron, but I've changed up a lot of my content over the last three years. And it's allowed me to reach new levels and whatnot. So these are some of the things that you can think about.
LS:And it was a conscious decision. It was more, I'm going to do this test, I'm looking for a result. It's either going to succeed or fail, but then I will learn and then apply those learnings to the next test that I run. Where so many people are just afraid to take that first step, what happens if it fails? That's okay. It's okay to fail. Fail quickly, learn fast, don't rinse and repeat.
BGJ:Yeah. 100%, and furthermore, if you're not really getting the kind of results that you're striving to get, and it doesn't work out, you're in the same spot. To me that's not a failure, you're still at zero. You're not at negative 100, you're at zero. You're just not at 100 yet. You're trying to get to 100. Well, you're still at zero, you didn't lose anything. What you found out was, well, that didn't work right now, today. But I'm going to keep moving forward.
LS:Okay. Perfect. So now, I'm going to run my experiments, I'm going to try a couple of things, now that I've learned from them, what else do I do?
BGJ:So, the first thing I would say is when we try things, to really give it a good shot and if you're going to start testing out your thumbnails, try a lot of different various thumbnails, for example. And don't think that a lot of times what I hear from YouTubers that are struggling, is the classic, oh I tried that and it didn't work. Remember, I'm striving to gain the skills needed to move myself to the next level. And the thing I think about today is, in order to grow, I need to become the YouTuber that can drive the results that I'm not today. I've got to evolve and grow and I've got to gain those skills.
And when I look at my channel from when I started to where I'm at now, I did that. I evolved, I grew, my editing got better, my delivery on camera, it got better. My thumbnails got better. And I don't say this because I like what I do, the audience tells me, when I look at my analytics and I see the numbers going up. That's how I know that I'm making improvements to my channel. Because I don't get to decide, it's not about me.
LS:It's a skill. It's a skill like every other skill in the world. Nobody was born knowing how to do maths and English and writing. You learn. But you develop over time. Just like every skill. All right. So what else can we do?
BGJ:So, we talked about thumbnails. The other thing I want to say is, really be perceptive to the topics that you could be covering, and furthermore, how you're going to cover the topics.
LS:Okay, so let's delve into that. So are we talking about trending topics? Are we talking about leveraging what everybody else is talking about? If it doesn't fit my channel, should I do it anyway?
BGJ:Yes, yes, yes. For me, again, and it really goes back to, who's it about? It's about the audience. So, I asked myself, okay, it's about the audience, what is the video that they have to click on? They might not even want to click on it, but what do they have to click on? So, a great example for me is this thing about Article 13 came out. And Article 13 is this law that's basically been passed into European Union kind of thing, they passed it. And it can and has the potential to change how YouTube works when it comes to things like common creatives, memes and whatnot.
And I kept seeing status updates from YouTube. I log into the creator studio, and I kept seeing Article 13, Article 13, and I kind of thought to myself you know, my audience, whether they even know it or not, on a subconscious level, they keep seeing stuff about Article 13. So, I made a video about that because I felt like that would be something they would have to click on. And it really worked. And the other thing I would say is, you mentioned trending topics. Again, Article 13 was, it just got passed into law. So I hopped on that trend.
But at the same time, it's like, I'm going to cover the evergreen content that viewers like you right now listening, want to hear. How can I grow? How can I get more views? How can I get more subscribers? But how you execute on those things will determine just how well your video performs. It's not just, well I tried that and I made that video, but I saw the topic and then I worked hard to create a title and a thumbnail that really compels the viewer to click and so on.
LS:This philosophy, would this apply across all channels?
BGJ:Again, I always start with, what does my audience want? Right? So everything is the audience.
LS:Back to the audience.
BGJ:We're going to talk about the audience for 30 minutes. Because you can't make any money until you win the trust of the audience. And to do that, you've got to really give them stuff that matters to them. So how can you move forward and really get those results, push the needle. Everything that I do, I'm asking myself, is this the video they have to watch? Are they interested in this video? And if you're like, well I'm just getting started, I don't know how to choose my audience. The thing you want to do is you really want to stop and say, what is my channel about? What is it going to evolve into? And I always like to use the phrase, become an important resource.
LS:Become an important resource. So something that your audience knows to expect and rely on you for, and therefore you're going to be part of their must click, their ritual almost, you're part of their lives now.
BGJ:Yeah, exactly. When you start thinking about my job is to become an important resource, I guess it's words with r, tongue twisters today. As we move forward, just really thinking about, what is it that the audience is going to click on. What they're going to get excited about and so on.
LS:We don't spend enough time actually understanding this and actually delving back into the analytics and seeing what's working vs what isn't.
BGJ:Right. Yeah and I think this is the talk and decision and the pondering that you've got to do with yourself. And you've got to really decide what do I value? And here's what I would say is, when you stop and you say what do I value? And what are the things that I really want? And then you own that, and you're like, if you really want to grow, you may not be able to do all the things that you want. But what's really cool is over time, you get more and more leeway because your audience gets to know, I can trust you.
LS:Okay, so it's building that trust, building that authority, providing value. The commodity that we're trading in at the moment is information and attention, and you've got to spend time building that. And what a lot of people, I think, do is they simply see what's working for these really massive YouTubers. The Casey Neistats of the world and the Peter McKinnons of the world. And they go, I'm doing exactly the same, how come I'm not winning?
BGJ:For about 16 reasons. A couple ideas are, number one is you're looking at a channel that is mature and has earned the trust of the audience. And you're comparing it to your channel that you just got started three months ago or six months ago. And you're not building that thing yet. If you go back and you look at PewDiePie's channel, you see two or three videos on different subjects and then it's video, after video, after video, after video on the same game, called Amnesia.
So think about this, if you're a gamer and you're really excited and you're into a game called Amnesia and you're really taken up by it and you want to research and you want to watch and listen and hear reports about the game and updates and what not, well there was PewDiePie doing game plays and just really sharing this experience of this game that so many people loved. And when you do that, what you do is you make it easy for a group of people to get excited about you and then they're going to know and watch, and get to like you over time. And that leads to that trust. So again, PewDiePie, had a niche when he started and he did the very thing that we've been talking about in this podcast. And that's undeniable. You go to his channel, you sort by date, you find the oldest stuff and it's that Amnesia, Amnesia, Amnesia.
LS:He had his focus. He saw that it was working, his audience responded and he just doubled down. He went all in on those topics, he became the authority on that topic. YouTube must have loved him for that topic. He became the guy, he became the channel.
BGJ:He was, exactly, he really dived into that kind of horror game play, horror games and what not. And I think he's sort of branching out into other similar games, so obviously if you're interested in one game and there's another game that's like it, you're going to be more likely to continue to watch, and his audience evolved. And then he got to a point where he was so big and he had such a loyal fan base that when he began to pivot, he had the thing that most YouTubers don't which was again, that dedicated audience that really digs what he does.
LS:Do you find there's a difference between kind of utility, how-to channels versus entertainment channels?
BGJ:Yeah I think there is. But what's really interesting is often times, you can bridge the gap. There's a lot of similarities that you can leverage. A utility channel over time can become more, not necessarily an entertainment channel, but people get to know, like and trust the person behind the channel. It really just depends on how much people connect with an individual YouTuber and the commonalities that they share.
LS:That makes sense. On my YouTube channel, I'm all about gadgets and technology and new phones. But a lot of people come there for the how-tos. So, top 10 tips on how to use the new Galaxy phone. I'm routing those trends, I'm enjoying those.
BGJ:Yeah. So for me, the thing I think about as far as it's an entertainment channel or resource channel, is I think about what is the passion level behind the person and the thing that they're looking at? So how passionate are people about unclogging their toilet? Zero. There's zero passion. I am interested in becoming vegan. I'm really curious about veganism. How much passion do I have about veganism? Well, I'm really interested, but it's a big thing. I better read a lot of books or possibly watch a lot of YouTube videos to try to uncover the mystery that is veganism. You know?
And these are the things that when you start to ask yourself, can I build a channel around this kind of topic? Well, tech really works well because people that love gadgets and tech, they like gadgets and tech for years and years and they keep upgrading and there's always new tech. New is a big deal, right? New is something that people really gravitate towards. So tech vloggers or tech YouTubers, they have an opportunity to really leverage that thing. So that's the thing that I always think, and I share with my clients is, what is the passion level behind the niche that you're thinking about going into? And if it's nil, we've got to really be careful because you might have one or two videos that do well, but are you going to have a lot of videos that do well? Maybe not.
LS:Down to the creator at the end of the day. It's down to how you bring it.
BGJ:Yeah, right. And this is a really great point is having that personality and what not, and bringing something else to the mix. One of the things that's so important - and I chose those words really carefully - is that it's not about being the best, and I think the reason why is because becoming the best is really challenging. There's only one the best. You can only compete and be the best for so long. But if you become an important resource in a topic or a niche that people are really passionate about, you really start to set yourself up for success.
LS:And again, it's down to the audience. It's down to them at the end of the day, you're serving their needs, their requirements, their searches. You're going to be the go-to person.
BGJ:Yeah, absolutely Liron. The other thing I want to share with this is, as you move forward, when you start to think about all of these things, so it's like, I'm going to make a decision on the focus of the channel, how can I ensure that success?
And when you start thinking about all of these things, you start making decisions based on big picture thinking. You're really stacking the deck in your favor. I think so many people get mixed up in the wrong stuff. For example, YouTube tags is a really strong example because the amount of weight that tags carry, how important are they to YouTube, when you publish your video?
Well, the honest truth is, they're not very important because the audience doesn't care. And the one thing you can always do is you can say, what are the things about a video that really matter to an audience? And when you do that, they've got to really like the content. And if they really like the content, they're going to watch the content. You're going to have better watch time metrics, average view duration, audience retention, watch time per impression, all the stuff you hear, the kind of phrase-y stuff that makes up the industry. Well, that starts panning out for you and you have great metrics because people love your videos.
So, I think when you really start understanding that, the easy button is the title. The easy thing is the keyword and they're super, super important, but we've got to focus and prioritize our efforts to what really is most important. And the elephant in the room, and I kind of started my talk today about this, was your individual delivery on camera or lack thereof, and you might be thinking, well I'm not on camera. Well, how is your voiceover? If your voiceover sucks, you lost. I mean, I hate to be that harsh about it, but at the end of the day, what really matters is to keep viewers watching. And nobody watches videos they don't dig.
And that means you've got to really have a structured video. You've got to know what you're going to cover. And you've got to deliver that content in a way that's compelling and engaging. Then you've got to spend the time to edit. You look at Peter McKinnon and Casey Neistat and those guys have got some pretty dope editing. Come on kids, I mean, you can feel me now, that's the truth. So, when you start getting really honest about what you're asking for, you're asking to be in the top 1% of YouTubers. Which means you've got to beat out 99% of all other YouTubers, that's a big ask. And you've got to work hard to prioritize your efforts, focus on what matters, build the thumbnails, blah, blah blah. You've heard it a million times.
LS:The one thing I really wish people would get to see is events like this, especially the family vlogging events. And the reason for it is because all you see is kids walking around here, with their cameras pointing at themselves, vlogging, and they love it. People here have shot seven, eight videos a day so far. Because they're that passionate. They know their audience wants this stuff. And they're able to deliver. Just look around these rooms, and look around the pool and look around the restaurants, all you see are these kids delivering again and again, and there's nothing half-assed about it.
BGJ:It's incredible, right? And having that passion and really doing the thing at a level that is kind of past the weekend warrior. A lot of us are not full time, a lot of us having working jobs, but when we look at success, when we look at what we want, almost always it's YouTubers that have been playing the game for a long time. And having that passion to sustain us for a long time, and being able to do those things is really, really important because this is not a one hit wonder. This is not an overnight success. It happens, but when you focus on that, and when it's the algorithms fault, and why isn't it me? The fact of the matter is, you'll find far, far more often, it's the people in the game playing it at the highest level have published hundreds and hundreds of videos. And they've been at it, and their skill sets are very high.
LS:And when you're honest with yourself, is your video really that much better than the person you're trying to beat out, so to speak? And in most cases, it really isn't. And unfortunately, that's just the reality.
BGJ:And the thing about it is, we all have an opportunity to frame things in a way that makes us really fun and really exciting. I think when we get unrealistic with where we want to go, when we come to the game, I think I mentioned this earlier, nobody's watching bad YouTubers. Think about this. The people that you dig, they're good. They're good on camera. They tell an engaging story. They cover tech in a way that's very thorough. They do their homework.
And when you start getting used to that, as far as their results, you're in really dangerous water because you're getting started, or you're not really putting in the effort or the passion level behind it. And you can really derail yourself and get disappointed. But when you're like, hey I'm just getting started, and I've got a lot to learn. I barely know how this camera works, but it looks a lot of fun. And you know, I'm going to give it a really good go. I'm going to publish 100 videos, I'm not going to look back. Yes, I want to grow. Yes, I'm going to expect those results, but I'm not going to expect them in a way that it breaks me.
And when you get to that point, the journey can be very rewarding. And the thing that I notice is people don't fail. People don't fail at YouTube. What happens is they give up on the dream and, or, they just kind of dial it in. But when you have the opportunity to really add that passion that you're talking about, when you show up and you try to make the best video on the topic of the new iPhone, or the camera quality of the iPhone, or this new diet that people are, it's just a big trend and this diet is amazing. And when you do a little extra work, people will notice and if you attack YouTube in that manner, one day a video's going to connect. And then at that point, you're going to know that you know what, this is possible.
LS: But don't expect it day zero, and certainly don't expect it to happen by miracle. You've got to be very, very specific, and very focused on your attention and what you're doing. Major businesses didn't happen overnight because they happened to be in the right location. They happen through sheer work determination, lots of failures, lots of adjustments and then doing more of it when they find the thing that they click with and that really, really works. So those are some really, really great, great advice. What's got you really excited at the moment?
BGJ:My next video.
LS:See, look how focused that was.
BGJ:Yeah, so I've always got a bunch of videos rattling around in my brain. Sometimes I think about them for a few months and start to work on it, and then I edit and I publish. And I have one that I feel has the opportunity to really connect with the audience. And what's interesting is I've built it around the topic and the title, and then the thumbnail. And once I had that in line, I made the thumbnail first, and I got the topic. And then I started really looking at the content. And I started going through you know, did I hit all the elements?
Well, the thumbnail, I know that thumbnail converts, because I've got thumbnails that are converting, it's the same style. Okay, check. How about the title? Yep, I've published videos, get a lot of clicks, the audience is very excited. Okay, check. Again, check. Well, how about the content? Okay, great. What am I going to cover? What are the points I'm going to make in the video? And these are the things I've been working on. And structuring my videos in this way has really allowed me to ultimately publish more videos that drive more views.
Because I'm building it around the most important parts like click through rate. We're hearing so much about click through rate, so if that's the thing that's important, maybe I should focus on achieving a high score with that, which means great title, great thumbnail. And once I have those in place, start building the video, scripting the video, bullet points, and so on. Again, I think that's the passion that you mentioned, it's so important. And I love the game. And Liron, the truth of the matter is, I'm going to publish this video and I'm going to give myself 50/50.
It might work, I might publish a video that drives a thousand views a day, or not. And you know what, either way, it's going to be great because I know that I'm going to publish another video that drives at least a thousand views a day. And I'm confident I can do that because I've gotten to where I am because I've continued to move forward and tried to focus on, again, not how do I get subs. If you're just asking how do I get subs, you never really get to the heart of the matter which is, I've got to gain the skills needed. I've got to become the YouTuber that I have to become in order to drive the views, gain the subscribers and grow my channel. And then show up and talk at these events, and hang out and have the brand deals, and make the money and enjoy the lifestyle that I desired years ago. And I've worked hard to make that happen. So, that's the thing I would really share with people that it's so important to focus on.
LS:It's funny how it's a mindset thing where so many people want those subscriber numbers, and that's the only thing that they're focused on. Versus, let me do a video course, let me do a better editing course, let me buy some better software. Let me improve my skills, because those are transferable. Those are something I can improve on, those are the kind of things that are going to really elevate me to the level, and then the subs will come. And then the views will come.
BGJ:100% yeah, you really hit the nail on the head. Slowing down enough to say, okay, I've really got to focus on the elements of a video. So, you mentioned video editing, I've got to edit the video. And my thumbnail has to be on point. And how I speak to the camera, how I deliver, how engaging my video actually is. These are all elements, and if the elements are bad, the video is bad. And the results you get are, again, bad. Which sucks, but you can't get blood from a rock. It is what it is. And the sooner you get to focusing on what matters, the sooner you get like, views are great, I want more. But I've got to focus on this thumbnail game because that can really have a big impact.
LS:Absolutely. And we can see, I mean, we've both been doing this for a very long time. You can see a channel and you can instantly see just from the thumbnail alone, someone who understands it, and someone who doesn't. Someone who's just taken a screen grab, because it was an afterthought, versus someone who's shot 20, 30 different thumbnails until they got the right one. And that's the difference between someone who's got the skills and someone who's just trying to hack the algorithm again.
BGJ:Yeah, absolutely. And Liron, I think as we kind of wrap up here, one of the things I want to share is if you're just getting started, if this seems overwhelming to you, at the end of the day, it's your job to upload videos. And one of the things you can do no matter how new you are, no matter how overwhelmed you may feel, is you can break it down. You can keep it simple, and you can upload, and you can know hey, I've got to figure out that niche thing. Hey you know what, I've really got to figure out those thumbnails. But I'm trying to learn editing, and the editing has got me stressed. And the lighting is really overwhelming. So right now, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to work on my lighting.
I'm going to focus on my lighting and I'm not going to worry about all the things until I get my lighting solved. And at that point, once I start understanding proper lighting, then maybe I'm going to go on and improve my audio. Or improve my thumbnails. And when you do that, what happens is you really start to leapfrog your skill sets. Because you're focused on one thing.
I see so many people that are like, I'm so overwhelmed, there's so many things, I don't know where to start. And they never start on anything. They have zero focus. And because of that, unfortunately, they don't drive the views.
LS:Or evolve. And that's why they attend every convention, they're constantly in research mode and they never actually take the second step. Going from zero to one is harder than going from one to two. You've got to actually make that happen.

Title: The Five Principles of New YouTube Success: TubeTalk Episode 156

The Five Principles of New YouTube Success: TubeTalk Episode 156
What is the secret to success on YouTube? On this episode of TubeTalk, the YouTuber podcast, we’ll discuss the five principles with our very special guestScott Simson. Scott practices what he preaches and has used the five principles process to drive 300,000 subscribers, and 100 million organic views across his YouTube channels in just 18 months. If you want to know what these principles are and how you can apply this formula to your own channelclick on the podcast link above.
As well as running a number of successful YouTube channels. Scott is also the owner ofRaffiti Mediaand the CEO ofVideo Marketing World, a Texas based convention for video creators and marketers.
The Five Principles of Success on YouTube
For anyone creating content on YouTube with the aim of increasing views and subscribers, there are a number of programming and audience development strategies they need to be aware of. YouTube expert Scott takes us through five of the most important:

#1 Find Your Focus Then Stay in Your Lane
Scott highly recommends focusing in on a topic or category that you are most familiar with, or are at a specialist at, and go all out on creating and promoting content about that theme on YouTube. At one time, creators could publish videos around a broad topic (for instance - family vlogging) and upload a wide variety of content from different angles. But as YouTube continues to refine its algorithm with the aim of surfacing relevant, quality content to viewers, creators need a single focus. In other words, you have to do one thing really, really well in order for the algorithm to like you.
Scott learned this lesson through experience last year when views tanked on his general ‘family’ content. While many other family-focused vlogging channels diversified and incorporated wider trends in their programming strategy, Scott made the decision to refine exactly what they wanted to offer their audience and double down, and triple down on content that has driven huge views and engagement. It’s a strategy that’s worked.
For any creator who is just starting out, Scott recommends that until you have established a base audience of people who are watching you, stick with one thing. Once you get into the hundreds of thousands, or even millions of subscribers and your daily views are in the hundreds of thousands or millions, then you can start to branch a little bit and do more of a variety because you have a core community of people that's large enough that will follow you wherever you go, whatever you do. At the beginning, the safest thing to do is to carve out your little niche on YouTube and focus exclusively on that for a good long while.
#2 Diversify Your Income from Video - Now
There was a time when you could predict your income from YouTube based off what you made in the previous year. Those days are long gone. Now, income can fluctuate month to month so YouTubers need to diversify where your income is coming in from. For Scott, that means not being reliant on Adsense income but looking at many other monetization opportunities including brand deals, product sales, affiliate links, lead generation etc. He advises any other creator looking to earn a passive income (or a more substantial income) to do the same.
Think of a product that you can sell and sell it from the beginning. Try and talk to brands early. Most companies now understand the power of influence on marketing, and so they're willing to deal with micro influencers, whether it be with product sales or with affiliate type of program or with just product trade for video time. Most brands now realize that's the power of YouTube and social video.
If you sell a product or service obviously your YouTube Channel is a great vehicle for sales or lead generation. Or, if there is a way to create a physical product around your channel (like an ebook) then that’s an opportunity for you to monetize too. Alternatively, you can leverage your subscriber base via affiliate marketing - essentially making money from that by linking out to something like an Amazon website or the company site that sells a product or service you promote. Every time somebody clicks on that link and buys something, you'll get a small commission. Scott does this and generates passive income across his YouTube Channels. As long as the creator discloses that affiliate links are being used via their terms and conditions, and in their ‘About’ section, an affiliate is a good way for pretty much every single niche Scott can think of.

#3 Understand Your Audience Purchase Power
Even more important than understanding your audience purchase power is to develop your audience purchase power. Just because you have a certain number of YouTube subscribers, doesn’t mean they will follow your lead and click through on those affiliate links. But if you are successful at promoting a product or service you can track activity on those affiliate links, and establish your purchasing power and your authority. That’s the kind of data you can then use to entice a brand as part of a deal. You can confirm you have an average of so many clicks and so many purchases made of the products you have promoted on your channel, and how much you will charge a brand based off that.
The best way to build purchase power is by promoting things that you are 100% passionate about. If you just take every crazy brand deal that comes your way then your purchasing power is going to be minuscule because people don't want the junk that you're pushing on them. But if you're promoting XYZ camera that has been amazing and these are the 15 reasons that I love it, then you're going to have more people who are going to want to purchase that camera based off of your testimonial or your review. Understanding and developing purchase power is massive.
#4 Play the Long Game on YouTube
YouTube is a marathon, not a sprint. Creators have to be prepared to be in it for the long haul, if they want to be massively successful. You can’t just throw one video up and then ask "Why aren't people watching?" because the YouTube algorithm doesn't work that way. You have to put in the leg work and you've got to do all of the right optimization things on the backend, like creating an awesome custom thumbnail and optimizing your keywords. It may be a few weeks before you start to pick up any traffic from the algorithm.
Creating just a few videos thinking you are going to become YouTube famous is not the case any more (unless you're bringing a massive audience over from Instagram, or Snapchat or TikTok). You've got to put in the time. There's no instant success anymore. Those very, very, very, very few channels that will blow up massively, they either making amazing content that nobody's ever seen before or they've got access to something nobody else has.
#5 Become an Important Part of Your Online Community
The fifth principle is about the importance of actually being part of a community, something Scott didn’t appreciate at the beginning of his creator journey. But as soon as he started to take it seriously he started to meet others in the family blogging community and build relationships with them, including collabs. He started to pick up tips about content creation and other aspects of being a vlogger. When you surround yourself with people that are doing the exact same thing that you are doing, you cut learning curves down because you learn from everybody else's mistakes and everybody else's wisdom at the same time. You get this masterclass just by hanging out with people that you are in the same boat with. And that's why it's super important to be part of your community, and attend video marketing and other similar events.
Also, jump onto online communities, like the thousands of YouTube groups there are on Facebook. There are things that are happening all the time where you can kind of build a little communities, sub-communities of creators. There are so many different ways that you can put yourself out there at different levels and get back what you're looking for.

A Complete Guide to Cracking the YouTube Algorithm with Matt Gielen: TubeTalk 167
We all seem to have a love-hate relationship with YouTube. We produce a video, and it does well, we love it. We produce a video, and it does poorly, then all of a sudden we blame YouTube and its algorithm. But is their algorithm really at fault here? Or perhaps it's our content? This week's episode of TubeTalk, the YouTubers podcast, will fundamentally change the way that you upload content to your YouTube channel.
Joining us today is Matt Gielen, who is a YouTube strategist, and a consultant to Netflix, Nickelodeon, MTV, and Comedy Central. You might have heard of some of these names. Matt is actually a code cracker, not in a hacker kind of way, but unpacking the YouTube algorithm seems to be his specialty.
In this podcast you will learn:

Understanding the YouTube Algorithm: Full Transcript
Liron Segev:So, Matt, one of your specialties is clearly understanding what this YouTube beast wants from us. Have you seen major changes in the algorithm and the way YouTube handles content?
Matt Gielen:Yes and no. So, basically, the algorithm, in my view, was very, very stable for about a solid three and a half, four years. Once they made the switch to watch time, there were a bunch of little things that caused big waves for certain areas of YouTube, but it kind of got to a very stable point and stayed very stable for two or three years. Then starting in late August, September of 2018, things just started going crazy. Things were a bit stable between, I want to say, October and November, about eight weeks. Then right about December 15th, everything went crazy again, and then, again, on January 15th and then February 15th or 18th, somewhere in that range.
Basically, every six to eight weeks we're seeing these massive changes in what is or what isn't being promoted. Some of that is algorithmic, and some of that is structural and policy. By structural, I mean making very specific decisions as to what will be put into suggested or browse, which seems to be a layer overriding the algorithm in some capacity. Or from a policy level, where some big news story will come out. YouTube will add something to the policy layer. Everything goes crazy. Then the pendulum swings back after a couple of weeks, once they start getting their feet underneath them again in response to whatever the issue is that week.
We had the outbreak that caused a huge issue in the kid space. Then we had, most recently, the Steven Crowder, right-wing personality and conspiracy theorist war. That's probably the most fresh. There's been a lot of pretty major hiccups over the last, I guess, nine months now that have caused fairly radical swings.
But I think, even more importantly, we saw the introduction of the DPP optimizer, which is Google's attempt to create, quote, unquote, diversity in the feed, which we just put out a video on our YouTube channel, ‘Reverse Engineering the YouTube Algorithm: Part Three’, because it was a massive structural change to the algorithm. We released ‘Reverse Engineering the YouTube Algorithm: Part Two’, I want to say, in 2017, 2018, which was a Google whitepaper that explained how they created the algorithm. It basically said there's two main big filters, candidate generation and ranking. Well, the DPP optimizer is a third massive filter. What the optimizer essentially does is, if you have a feed, like in browse for example or the Facebook feed as an example, typically, the way they sort the items in that feed is from best to worst. User A is likely going to be interested in these 100 videos. We've ranked them from 1 to 100.
Well, for that user and for any user, the optimal actual layout of that feed might not be to go from best to worst. It might be like put the best one at spot seven. Put the worst one at spot 24. That's basically optimization by group as opposed to optimization by individual video. It's really fascinating if you read the paper, or you can watch our video to see an overview of it. YouTube has come out and said we want to provide more diverse opinions, or we want to provide a wider set of topics, and it's really not that. Basically, it's we want to hack your brain to make you stay on the website longer, and what we found was, by pulling more videos from your history and leaning a little bit heavier into collaborative filtering, we found that we can make you stay on our website longer. It's basically like, hey, we made a better heroin. It has nothing to do with exposing people to different opinions or exposing more creators. It's 100% solely based on the fact that we can get you to stay on our website longer if we pull more videos from your history.
LS:The longer you stay, the more ads they can serve. The better the business grows, all of that good stuff. YouTube's still a business at the end of the day. The interest isn't to shove you off the platform
MG:Exactly.
LS:That makes sense. But now does that mean that YouTube looks at individual videos compared to a channel as a whole?
MG:Oh, yeah, I don't think they look at channels as a whole at all, actually, other than to make recommendations to audiences based on which videos to serve them next. So in part two and part three, they go into a lot depth, but basically saying, to program our website, we program to the individual. So each individual has a distinct watch history, and we look at their watch history in order to make recommendations to them for what they are going to want to watch in their next session.
So, for example, if you're a big fan of Rosanna Pansino and you have all of her videos in your watch history. What YouTube will do is, next time you come to the platform, they'll say, wow, this person always engages with Ro's videos every time we put one in front of them. She is just releasing a video, so let's put this video in front of that person, assuming that that video has done well with other viewers on the platform that also have similar watch histories or similar demographic information. So if you upload a video to your channel and your audience doesn't choose to click on it or, if they do, they don't stay on it for very long, you don't get good average view duration, YouTube will say, well, this video isn't very good when we serve it to people that are really engaged with this channel. Let's not serve it to any more people like that. Let's use that space for something else, whether it's another video from your channel, or a video from someone else's channel.
LS:Got it. What about your next video? So in other words, you served a video. It did really well. Is the likelihood of your next video being looked at more favorably, or is it each video on its own merit, good or bad?
MG:It's each video on its own merit, good or bad with one exception. Let's say you average 1000 views per week on your uploads. If you have a video that comes out and does 2,000 views in that first week, well, now you have doubled the number of people with one of your videos in their recent watch history. That is a strong signal to YouTube that your next video should be served to a wider set of people, because that previous video is in more people's watch history. So that next video might have a better chance of doing well because there are more people with one of your videos in their recent watch history.
So, yes, your videos are going to impact each other. It's a symbiotic relationship, where if you have a video that's doing really well consistently and that's bringing more viewers to your channel, it doesn't matter if that video was posted a week ago or 10 weeks ago or 5 years ago, those people that are watching that video within those last seven days, one months, two months, all have one of your videos in their recent watch history, even if that video is from long ago. So your new videos are going to be put in front of those people, which is one of the main reasons why, if someone shifts their content type and does it too abruptly, they can really struggle to grow that new content type because people aren't there for that new content type. They're there for that old content type, and that leads to eventual death spirals on YouTube, often.
LS:Could we be forcing relationships on YouTube between our videos? Obviously, we put end screens. We put in cards. We put in links in the description, put in a comment with links to our other videos. Does YouTube take all of that into account as well when deciding to suggest videos?
MG:Yeah. They absolutely do. I would say that that should not relieve the content creation or the channel manager of the onus of creating those connections. But, essentially, what you're describing is collaborative filtering or one of the things that goes into collaborative filtering. So you can look at collaborative filtering in a few ways. One of the ways you already kind of mentioned, where if you upload a new video and your viewers really love it and click on it a lot, they will serve it to more and more people that have one of your videos in their watch history, but maybe aren't as active on the platform or it's a little bit older. Then they'll serve it to people beyond that that just have expressed interest in the topic or have similar watch histories.
MG:The other aspect of it is, if a whole bunch of viewers watch video A and then they go on to watch video B, well, people who have watched video A but have not watched video B are more likely to be recommended video B because so many people who watched video A went on to watch video B. That's in suggested or even in browse. If you can create those kind of viewership paths within your content by end screens, playlists, call to action, links in descriptions, pinned comments, links on your channel, etc, then you are more likely to have YouTube promote more of your own content against your own content, but also put your content in front of similar viewers throughout the platform.
LS:To me, this makes complete sense. Shoppers that have bought A would also like to buy B. It's the same kind of Amazon mentality, but on videos, where they like this content, they're more likely to like that content - let me help them along with that. Now you've mentioned a lot about views, but you didn't mention subscribers. Are we making too much of a thing about subscribers because subscribers have changed over the time? Is it all about the views? Or are subscribers still a thing?
MG:I'm not sure, but I don't think it matters. So, generally speaking, I don't know if you watched my response video to Derrick from Veritasium's video, My Video Went Viral. Here's Why. Essentially, back when Google first released the One Channel, it was wrapped up with Google+, and it was a whole initiative that fell flat on its face and was absolutely awful. I mean, look, I love YouTube. YouTube has allowed me to be unbelievably successful and start my own business, and I will jump to their defense whenever I can, but sometimes we've got to call them out because sometimes they just make terrible decisions. It's not always their fault.
So during that time period, what they did was anyone who created an account was basically auto-subscribed to dozens and dozens of channels across many different verticals that had nothing to do with any interest they'd ever expressed. So you had these channels that went from a million subscribers, to several million subscribers, and most of their subscribers had never seen a single video from them ever before, had no idea how they were, didn't click on their stuff. A lot of them were like I can't get any viewership because you're putting my videos in front of people that have no interest in them because you auto-subscribed them.
YouTube was like, oh, well let's just make subscriptions unimportant. So it was like, wait, what? They're like, yeah, we screwed this thing up, and so we'll just keep screwing it up. Unfortunately, they can't undo that. So they were like, okay, now we're going to have people subscribe, and then they're also going to ring a bell. Then they're going to have options for that bell. Then even if they select some options, we still might not send stuff to them.
I've worked with channels across the board, big, small channels, everything in-between. Almost none of them get more than a handful of percentage points of their viewership from notifications. I can tell you on the Little Monster channel, we're brand new, so all of our subscribers are pretty fresh and pretty active. For us, I think it's like 3% is from notifications, which is, I think, the highest I've ever seen it. Over the last 28 days, it's our seventh biggest traffic source. It's responsible for 3.7% of our views, and that's 300 total views, and we've released 5 videos. It's just like, okay, I can't focus on notifications. I don't really have any control over that. Telling people to ring a bell is way less valuable than telling them to go on and watch more videos, so I ignore that.
Then if you look at subscriber views versus non-subscriber views, that can vary wildly. I've seen channels doing hundreds of millions of monthly views that have 3% from their subscribers and some that have 20% from their subscribers. But if you look at the traffic sources on that, it's all browse and suggested. So whether someone has subscribed to your channel or not is such a low impact signal from what I've seen, in terms of what gets suggested to them, that, really, exerting any sort of effort there is not nearly as good as exerting effort towards understanding your audience and your viewership, what they're interested in, and thinking about your programming towards that general audience, because YouTube cares far, far, far more about how someone has interacted with your content the last time it was put in front of them or the last several times it was put in front of them than they care at all about whether or not someone subscribed.
LS:So at the end of the day, we're once again circling all the way around back to the viewer. It's all about them, their experience, and what they would want to most probably see next, and then engage with it. Speaking of engagement, do you find, in your experience, that things like give the video a thumbs up and leave a comment ... Does that also add to good signals as well as the watch time and when somebody rewinds your video and watches it again?
MG:They are all taken into account, and YouTube said that they were looking at total time spent on site, including time commenting. It's like, yeah, they've been doing that for five years. It's called watch time.
The more engaged your audience is, the better. If someone's just passively viewing and it's kind of like they can watch or they could pass on it, well, you're kind of in a bad situation. You want people hyper engaged, if you can. Some of the ways to do that is to get them to like the video and to comment on it.
One thing they did say is we're taking things like what people like and what they dislike into account. It's like, well, are they saying like and dislike from the engagement or like and dislike based on the implicit signals that they're sending? Because if you look at Reverse Engineering: Part Three, I'm not sure if I cited it in the video, but in the actual paper they say that explicit signals are actually not very good from viewers, with the exception of surveys. But they're not surveying you after every single video you watch. They're surveying you on a session basis to say how was your last session. Are you satisfied with your time on YouTube? Because YouTube doesn't care about the individual video. They don't care about the individual creator. They care about the individual viewer. They want to know if the viewer's experience was good.
You can't be confident in the accuracy of their answer, and so they look for the signals that you don't consciously think you're sending by clicking on that one more video or clicking on that one thumbnail with the scantily clad girl. When you see that it's just some dude playing a video game, you're like, oh, I'm out of here. It's a guilty pleasure thing that you're not going to admit to, but YouTube sees those signals. They know exactly what you're doing. So they make those suggestions based, I think, far more on the implicit feedback than on the explicit of like, dislike, comment, survey kind of thing. But the one thing I haven't said yet, which is by far the most important thing, is click-through rate.
Click-through rate is the number of impressions divided by the number of people that click on it, It’s king, by far, 100%, and will be king until YouTube fundamentally changes the way they promote videos to people. By fundamentally, I mean, right now the way they promote videos to people, essentially, is by showing them a thumbnail and title. Now with the mobile feed going to a preview and now basically just playing videos in that mobile feed if you sit on it long enough, that's going to change things up a little bit. But right now it's click-through rate, basically.
When we think about click-through rate at Little Monster, what we think about is click-through rate actually starts on the whiteboard. Your programming choice has such a huge impact on your click-through rate. When MrBeast says, okay, we're going to make a video. What are we going to do? They don't go away and give $1,000. They give away $100,000. That might seem like a small programming choice, but it's a huge, huge deal. You're talking about millions of more people that are excited to see a $100,000 giveaway than a $1,000 giveaway.
What you choose to make a video about, in large part, is going to determine your title thumbnail. If you talk to a lot of YouTubers, a lot of YouTubers go, oh, yeah, I think what's going to make a great title and thumbnail, and then I make a video about that that would deliver on the value proposition of the programming choice as reflected in my title and thumbnail so that people stay and watch it. Because click-through rate doesn't really mean all that much if people click away from your video and you don't get the average view duration.
So, again, there's another one of these symbiotic relationships where it's like you can't just focus on one thing. You've got to be an amazing programmer, making a great video and choosing to make a great video. You've got to be great at production so that your content is high quality and ad friendly and all these other things. Then you also have to be an amazing marketer in that title and thumbnail.
LS:At the end of the day, it's the people that really understand not to go ready, fire, aim. You can't take out your camera, shoot for nine hours, and then go, oh, I wonder what I'm going to do with this footage. If you're very deliberate and very purposeful, you'll win so much more, especially when you're using the various tools, when you're using YouTube's own autocomplete. You're going to get all those hints of stuff that people actually care about, make your content around that. That is immediately a leg up to the previous scenario, where you ready, fire, aim.
MG:I would caution on the autocomplete. I think autocomplete is a great starting point, but you want to run all of those autocompletes through Google Trends, and make sure you're shifted to YouTube search, just to confirm, because some of those autocompletes are off topic or from too long ago.
LS:Relevancy for today is critical. The typical example just to prove it is when you go and if you do a search for, I don't know, Mother's Day now. That's come and gone. The interest of this is flat. But if you just did a search for Mother's Day, you're going to be seeing a million videos. So the two are very, very different. It's all about relevancy and time, as opposed to, oh, it's got six million views. It must be a good video. I'll make one just like it. The iPhone 4, when it came out, and the Galaxy Note 1, when it came out, I'm sure had millions of views. But how relevant is it today? Matt, do you think we should be focusing on writing titles and descriptions for humans? Or should we be doing writing titles and description more keyword stuffing for machines?
MG: Oh, I mean, obviously, you want to do it for humans. When we think about optimization, what we think is, essentially, what is more likely to get a viewer to click on this, rather than what is going to make a machine understand this, because click-through rate is so much more important than anything else. YouTube will figure out what your video is about. It will do that by listening to and watching, now, your video. I don't know if you had a chance to play around with the Cloud Vision.
YouTube are just going to get better and better and better at understanding your content, and they'll be far better than humans, because humans get tunnel vision. We don't pay attention to stuff going on, on the edge of the frame if the central focus is the middle of the frame, but a computer can see it all. Then they look at things like comments and how does your metadata match up to what they're seeing and is that accurate and have you been historically accurate.
But all of that is basically they look at comments, because in determining the language of a video, it's actually far more accurate to look at the language used in the comments than it is to rely on what the creator put in as their language, especially for older videos.
LS:Wow. Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa. The obvious question is, what happens if you're new and you've got no comments?
MG:Well, one it's very important that you actually put the language of your video into the video metadata, in part because, for eight or nine years, that wasn't even an option. So there's eight or nine years of videos that probably just have no language set to them, other than what YouTube has gone through and determined, if it's made it to that video yet. It's relatively new, and a big part of how they make recommendations is on contextualization. So contextualization has everything to do with where is the viewer watching. What device are they watching it on? Are they watching it on Wi-Fi? Are they watching it on their cell phone or via a telephone etc. The age of the viewer, the race, other demographic information. They're adding these contextualization layers at multiple points in their recommendation. So what that's doing is, as it pertains to the previous comment about language, if the person generally watches content in the English language, they're going to be 1,000 times more likely to just serve them content in the English language. If someone always watches with closed captions on, they are 1,000 times more likely only to serve them content with closed caption. That's the level of granularity they're getting to, which it's mind-boggling
To actually answer your question, if you have no comments, then it's even more important that you're uploading the transcript. But if you have no comments, you don't have much of an audience, most likely, and so I would be far less concerned about YouTube understanding what your video is about and far more concerned with how do I get in front of people that I think will like this. An old colleague of mind at my previous job had a saying. If your mom and dad or your friends and family don't want to watch your content, it's probably the content. So it's like that's where you start.
When I started the Little Monster channel, I had a small following on LinkedIn. 5,000 followers on LinkedIn is like 5,000 followers on Twitter. It's nothing, but I started posting our YouTube videos and would post teasers for the YouTube video to my LinkedIn audience, and got a little bit of traction of those people coming over to YouTube and watching and watching with their YouTube accounts. So from there, YouTube would serve it to more and more people. Then with a few of the connections I'd made on YouTube over the years, other creators on the platform, they would like the videos or comment on the videos. That would get a few more people watching and a few more people watching and a few more people watching.
That began to snowball where we started this channel in January of this year, and we haven't been great about it - trying to run an agency and a YouTube channel at the same time is not easy. We've got a couple thousand subs now. When we put up a video, it's going to get 1,000 views or so within the first week. That's not bad for a channel that was started in January for a company that basically had no audience.
You mentioned early on these big names that we consult for, and we're extremely well-known in the industry, which is great. But we're not very well-known in the creative community and in the broader YouTube fan community at all. Now we've given presentations at VidCon and that kind of thing, but we haven't been on a platform for years. It's like just no one knows who we are there. We just don't have any reach there. So it's part of why we're doing this, because we put all this love and work into these massive papers, and we put them out on Tubefilter, and they'd get tens of thousands, a couple hundred thousand reads, but I have no idea if that's industry or creators. Who's that helping? So it's like, well, if we're YouTube people, we should probably have a YouTube channel.
To be perfectly honest with you, part of the reason why we just never started a YouTube channel for the first two years is just me being self-conscious about being on camera. Finally, I was like, get over it. Just put yourself on the goddamn camera. No one cares.
LS:The philosophy of doubling down on content that works. That still holds water. So if people are here for a certain type of content, then you give them more of that content, and they're likely to watch it. Give them more of that content, they're likely to watch it. Rinse and repeat. That still holds true. Is that correct?
MG:100%. I think it's more important than ever. You absolutely 100% have to be focused on a niche, if your goal is to grow. If you just want to make videos that are fun that you feel like doing, great, fine. But if your goal is to grow on YouTube, then, yeah, you have to find what that throughline is, and then you can kind of make whatever you want. So a lot of YouTube channels, the throughline is the personality. Sometimes it's a mutual interest in video games. Sometimes it's a mutual interest in woodworking or skateboarding, whatever it is. The fans are there because they like your personality and you have that shared common interest. But if you look at a lot of creators, oftentimes, it's just that they want to hang out with that creator. Those creators can be free to do any format they want.
MG:But if we take Epic Meal Time as an example, any video Epic Meal Time put up that was not in Epic Meal Time format just wouldn't do as well. Yeah, viewers liked the personality, but they wanted that format. They wanted to see them cook that crazy thing. They wanted that show. So if your audience has really evolved around one particular format, you have to be careful about going too far away from that format from a viewership perspective.
LS:5-Minute Crafts does 5-minute crafts. If they did something weird, you'll maybe give them one or two opportunities, but most likely if they don't come back to their call, you're going to move on so they have to deliver. Do you see a difference between how-to channels and entertainment channels?
MG:Yeah, great question. So we refer to them as utility channels. So you have your entertainment channels where people are there to be entertained, and that can take on millions of different forms. A utility channel is a channel that people come to for information and then leave. Now the then leave part is not the desired intent of a utility channel. It's just what happens. The reason why is that utility is an exchange. I'm exchanging my time in watching this video and potentially a tiny fraction of a penny or whatever it is in exchange for the information you are giving me. What ends up happening is there's no reason for someone to watch your next video, often, because they've gotten that piece of information.
Now things that you can do to mitigate that is make your utility channel an entertainment channel. There's three main ways to do that. So first is the MKBHD way, where you make your videos so incredibly stylish that they become works of art, so that I don't care if he's talking about an iPhone or a TV or home lighting, I'm going to watch it because they're beautiful. The next way is from a personality perspective. This is more of a HouseholdHacker approach. I think it's HouseholdHacker, where people just love his personality, that they don't care if he's sitting in a gray room. They're just like, yeah, this dude's awesome. I'm going to watch anything he puts up.
Then the third way is to have a format that is so interesting that people don't care what product you're talking about. They're watching for the format or a combination of all three of those. But if you're just topic ... You're like, oh, I've just got to get this iPhone the moment it comes out because it matters if I put my video up before someone else, well, you're never going to win that race. You're always going to be chasing YouTube search. You're never really going to grow. Most of your videos are going to get ... If you have 100,000 subs, most of your videos are going to get a couple thousand views if you're lucky. You're just going to be hoping that you get that one video that breaks or that you're just big enough to get a brand deal here or there or whatever it is, if you don't have one of those things that's driving everything. Generally speaking, we very, very much discourage a utility channel that's not pursuing being an entertainment channel.
LS:So a lot of us just had a mini heart attack as we listen to this. How do we convert them to become more entertainment?
MG:Well, to give myself a plug, I wrote an entire guide as to how to do that.
LS:Funny you should mention that, because this is the exact time of the show where I normally say to you, so, Matt, what have you got going on? Where should we find you?
MG:Well, you can certainly check out our YouTube channel, and on Twitter. You can also check out all our work on Tubefilter.. What I was going to mention about utility channels, the resource for them is The Taxonomy of YouTube Videos. It's a free paper. I put it out on Tubefilter, or you can watch our series on it on our YouTube channel. But if you read that, that's basically a guide to developing fresh and unique content on YouTube by understanding what's popular on YouTube now and breaking it down into easily usable items.
Cracking the YouTube Algorithm 2020
Then the big news isCracking YouTube 2020. It is going to be looking at 200,000 YouTube videos, 20,000 YouTube channels, and seeing what we can draw from all of those channels of data. So I'm very excited about that. One thing I can spoil is that Cracking YouTube in 2017, what we saw was that videos that were between 7 and 16 minutes, videos that got 6 to 8 minutes of average view duration, had much greater performance than videos that were shorter or longer.
Now in Cracking YouTube 2020, which is the paper that's coming out, we've done a fair amount of the research so far. Now we've got a long ways to go, but what we're seeing, one, is that there's less dependency on generating high average view durations on average, but there's something that's very interesting that happens, where we're seeing videos that are a couple of minutes in length, they tend to perform not quite as well as other videos. But at four minutes, we're starting to see pretty decent first-day viewership, at least on par with five and six minutes. That starts to go down a little bit at seven, eight, nine minutes. But a really interesting thing happens when a video goes from 9 minutes and 59 seconds to 10 minutes, which is that viewership jumps by somewhere between 20 and 40% on average.
I was very, very skeptical when I saw the data. I went through, quadruple checked my work, but I went and I looked at 2017, and the same exact thing happened in 2017. There's a jump. I thought it was just an issue with the data when I presented it, and I didn't even bring it up, because I was like, this has got to be something funky here. I never had a chance to go and circle back. But when I saw the same phenomenon happen in 2020, I said, okay, what is going on? I went and I looked at it. This is, at the very least, true for first-day viewership.
Now this could be something algorithmic. Something with that kind of jump feels algorithmic to me, but, hear it me out, it could also just be viewership, just viewers, where a 9 minute and 57 second video just feels long. You're like, oh, God, 9 minutes and 57 seconds, God. But a 10 minute and 2 second video, that doesn't seem so long. I'm wondering if it's like, if you want to watch a short video, 9 minutes is long. But if you want to watch a long video, 10 minutes is short. I don't know. We have a lot more data research to do, but that was the nugget I was talking about earlier where it's like, okay, this is not a coincidence anymore. This is a pattern, and we need to look further into this. We're going to go into that. We're going to go into a ton of depth on frequency of posts, a lot on average view duration. We've got a lot of data around both suggested and browse.

Title: Why Story Telling is the Most Valuable Skill For Any YouTuber: TubeTalk 201 with Jordan Bower

Why Story Telling is the Most Valuable Skill For Any YouTuber: TubeTalk 201 with Jordan Bower
Why do we gravitate towards the same YouTube creators, publishing the same kind of content again and again? It's not like nobody else is talking about those same topics, but yet we choose to go return to certain channels. There is something that draws us in time and time again. Why is that? Well, there's a secret sauce, a magic ingredient, and on today’s Today episode of TubeTalk, we're going to be discussing that exact ingredient.
I think it's fair to say that I've seen a fair number of channels, big and small, with creators across virtually every vertical, and every niche. Something that's always struck me is, how come two channels, which are virtually the same could get radically different audiences? How come some get more subscribers, and more views, versus others which may have equally great content, but are just not resonating with the YouTube audience? What's that missing ingredient that the one channel doesn't seem to have?
Well, one critical element is the way the story is told. Being a great storyteller is critical on YouTube. We've been telling you this forever now. Which is why I'm super excited today to speak withJordan Bower, who is the Founder of Transformational Storytelling, a facilitation coaching and consulting business based in Vancouver, Canada. Jordan spends most of his time leading business storytelling workshops for some of the biggest companies in the world. In this podcast you will learn:

Why Story Telling is the Greatest Skill For Any YouTuber: Full Transcript
Liron Segev: Jordan, welcome to TubeTalk.
Jordan Bower: Thanks, Liron. I'm happy to be here.
Liron Segev: Tell me, what do you do, this transformational consulting, this storytelling consulting? This sounds exciting. What do you do that?
Jordan Bower: Yeah, so I'm a Storytelling Consultant. Maybe I'll just take a quick second to give you a sense of how I got into this in the first place. When I was about 26, 27 years old, I went through what I called at the time, my quarter-life crisis. Imagine, I had a job I hated. I had a girlfriend I liked but didn't like enough. I was feeling like I just didn't know who I was in the world. I wanted to do something more meaningful.
I wanted to do something more creative. I had an okay job, but not a great job. I was thinking like, "What do I do?" One day, over the course of more or less two weeks before my 26th birthday, I quit the job. I dumped the girlfriend. I moved out of my house and I bought a plane ticket to India.
Over the next more or less three years, I went back and forth to India, three times for about six months. India is cheap, which meant it was an easy place for me to travel for that extended time. I spent a lot of time when I was there, wandering around, meeting people and really poking at my own story. "Who am I? What does it mean to be someone like me in the world and what do I want to do?"
At the end of a bunch of soul searching that ended up taking about five years, and ended with me walking from Canada to Mexico, I founded this business called Transformational Storytelling. The work that I do in the world, is often with big organizations. Although I work with everybody, from small entrepreneurs, all the way to some of the biggest companies in the world. I teach storytelling in a way that's a little bit different than most people think.
Most people tend to think that storytelling is like, I'm going to get up on stage and I'm going to tell you this anecdote. For me storytelling, like what story literally means, is taking information and infusing it with emotion.
Who want to motivate people to change, the leaders of organizations, salespeople. I work with lots of people across some of the world's biggest organizations, teaching them how to speak with more emotion. Which is going to give them more trust, more credibility and most importantly more connection.
You can imagine like, what's the most common question any of us get? You know that question, "What do you do?" Maybe you've got an answer. "Oh, I'm a YouTube creator, I've got a channel like this. I'm a consultant, I'm a whatever." People would say, "What do you do?" I noticed myself having to tell the story over and over again. Gradually what literally happened is, I got sick of my story.
I started having to think, "Well, how can I tell the same story in a different way?" That insight is the heart of what I teach people now. How to tell the same story in a different way, so it's going to be more meaningful, more trusting, more impactful on whoever your audience is.
Liron Segev: Well, and whoever your audience is is pretty important. Identifying who you're speaking to, do you then adjust your story accordingly?
Jordan Bower: Yeah, and I mean, this is maybe the jumping-off place for good storytelling. Is, there's never one story. What you learn, what we all learn as we're communicating is, how do we find a match between the story we want to tell and the whoever we're trying to connect with? I use the acronym harmony, we're going to get into this a little bit later.
Harmony is like two voices different singing together. When you're communicating information to somebody else, even if your information is smart, solid, logical, one person is going to think a bit differently than the next person will.
To be a good storyteller, is to have an aspect of being kind of like a chameleon, where you find creative, innovative ways to tell the story a little bit differently. Depending on what you're trying to get across, and who you're trying to get it to.
Liron Segev: Does that mean that storytelling can be done effectively, by all types of niches, all types of industries? Whether you are a vlogger, but also the how-to type channels. The, looking for a solution channels, like “How do I unblock my toilet?" Once people know how to unblock the toilet because you've told them how to do this, there really isn't a reason to subscribe to come back to your next video, because you've just given them a solution.
__Could we use the storytelling elements, to not just give them the information that people want, but also to connect with that audience?__
Jordan Bower: Yes, and I would even go one step further to say that, you are already telling a story no matter what you think. There's already a choice that you're making. If you're just talking about your toilet, and you're shooting your toilet and you're shooting how to fix it, I mean, you're telling a story.
Liron Segev: Are there certain elements of a story that we need to pick out, and we need to deliver in a certain way? Or maybe I should just give them the facts, give them the specs and then get out of there.
Jordan Bower: Well, I like to say that, learning storytelling is different than say learning code or learning a foreign language. If I tried to learn... I don't know, Russia. I have to start from scratch. I got to learn, what does the alphabet look like? What are the basic words to say things like me and you?
I have absolutely no basis for that learning framework. Storytelling is different. Every single one of us has been steeped in stories. We've been listening to stories and telling stories, since the moment we came into this planet.
It's a very interesting skill to learn, because all of us start with no experience and gradually and steadily build up experience. I like to say that, when we're thinking about storytelling or learning, or trying to become a better storyteller, there's really three Ts. I call these Ts: tools, tactics, and taste.
Good storytellers are iterators. Which means they try, we fail, we try again, we fail. Gradually, we slowly get to the heart of the story. We need to go through a process of trying things out, and seeing how the audience reacts. It's one thing to have a thought, and it's something different to take that thought and put it into form. The tools of storytelling are all about iteration.
Of course, they can be learned and they're simple. It can be as simple as writing something out, doing some reflective writing, editing, coming back to it over and over again. The tools are simple. The tools are all about effort.
The second T, I call it tactics. What you'll see about tactics, is that there are certain commonalities of great stories that apply across the board. Whether we're talking about how-to videos, whether we're talking about one-on-one connection videos from influencers, or Hollywood movies, or good advertising or great books, or speeches, or Ted talks.
Any or most of them are built on the same basic foundational tactics. The reason those tactics work, is because they're linked to the way our brains work, right? There's like certain ways that we learn and process information as human beings, and the cognitive biases that go with it. That makes us more susceptible and more interested in narrative techniques or tactics.
The third thing is taste. I think this one is really important. It's really important that we know what a good story looks like for ourselves, so we have something to aspire to. The more that you can develop your taste of what's good and what's not, that helps to guide the creative development.
All three of those things together, tactics, tools, and taste are essential for the process of becoming a good storyteller.
Liron Segev: Could talking-head videos still be able to make those connections? Or our visuals and story go so hand-in-hand, we have to think much bigger?
Well, I want to equivocate and say both. Which means that, if you're going to make a talking-head video, your talking-head video will certainly be much, much more interesting by becoming a better storyteller.
Storytelling can be a massive business, and it can be a totally micro-business. The important part to know is that the approach and the tactics are exactly the same. Once you start getting good at it in an inexpensive way, then it's quite natural to start to see how you might be able to scale.
If you know how to grab people's attention and connect to them, people are interested in you. They want to be able to find the people who have that specific skill.
Liron Segev: Okay, what are the elements that make up a good story?
Jordan Bower: I've used this word, harmony because it really rings true in terms of, storytelling is emotional and it's something that we should feel resonating inside of us. When we're thinking about a good story, it's important not to take these ideas and call them how-tos. They're more like ideas, guiding ideas that can help us understand good composition.
It's important to know first, before we go any further, to know that these aren't rules. Storytelling is an art. Like any art, rules are made to be broken. You're going to find these kinds of principles across all good stories, no matter what they are.
Every great story is based on hooks. It's not just a hook that starts the story, but it's the series of hooks that move us through the story. The English word, ‘entertain’, literally means to hold between. If you look at that in the etymology, at entertain, hold between. What is it that we're getting held between? One really easy way to think of this, is the question and the answer.
The word ‘suspense’ literally means asking a question and then suspending the answer. Let me give you an example. "You'll never guess who I just saw in the coffee shop. Before I tell you that, let me just give you a little bit of background."
You see what I did? Is I offered you a question, with some sort of compelling answer and now I'm suspending the answer. It's worth thinking about, well, what kinds of questions are compelling? If I said like, "You'll never believe what's on the bottom of my shoe." Or like, "You'll never believe what the most popular word in the newspaper was today."
The most compelling questions are the ones that promise an emotional payoff. If I ask you a question that promises some sort of emotional payoff, you're going to be interested.
People can't remember what they had for breakfast yesterday, but they can remember the climax of a movie they watched 30 years ago. How is that possible? Well, the answer is emotion. The stronger the emotion, the more meaningful it's going to be for the audience. We hook people with emotional content.
__Liron Segev: You give them a pitch, more of, "Today, I'm going to show you five reasons or five ways to make your Wi-Fi faster. Stay tuned, and I'll show you how to do that." We told them about the same kind of hook.__
Jordan Bower: That's a really nice clear hook. The next question is, how do you take a hook like that and add an emotional payoff?
I'm linking two things together. I'm linking the piece of information that I wanted to communicate, but I'm wrapping it in emotion that's going to make it more interesting for folks. In great stories, there's not just one hook. There is a progression of hooks that build on top of each other. One question leads to the next question. What happens over the course of the story is that questions become more specific because we know more now. You know this pattern because it's in every single movie you've ever watched.
When it comes back to a YouTube video, even if you're doing a how-to, it's like, how do you find a number of hooks that are going to lead somebody all the way through to the end? How do you hold the juiciest, most emotionally meaningful moment of the whole video to almost at the very end, so people will watch all the way to get to that? Yeah, that's the question
Liron Segev: We've got H. What's the A?
Jordan Bower: The A, is of course Audience. How do we know our audience? We might say, "Oh yeah, my followers are women aged 24 to 30. Or my followers love toilets. The question for all of us is, how do we go one level deeper? Who are they really, these people? What is it in our story that's going to be truly interesting to them? Who are they as people? What values do they have? What are they yearning for at a real human level deep inside?
Being able to reach your audience at that level, that really captivates us. It's really important when you're considering your audience and think about, "Which of these major deep human themes are going to be the one most likely to resonate?" Remembering that the audience isn't just looking for toilet advice, they're looking for life advice wrapped up in toilet advice. How do you bring those two things together? Does that make sense?
Liron Segev: Yeah, so you're already thinking of your content very differently. Instead of, first you put A, and then you do B and then you do C, that's the boring bit. That's just the how-to, it’s how else do you bring people along for that ride?
Jordan Bower: It's a strange thing about making content because you write a book, you make a video, you do any of these things, you spend so much time thinking about what you think you're trying to get across.
Most of us spend much less time watching the video from the audience's perspective, and seeing the stream of content as if you were them. What A reminds us to do, is to get out of ourselves, however we can, and literally switch sides of the screen.
Now, you're your audience watching back at you. How do you look from their perspective? What do they know or not know about you? What might they want to know more of about you, or the subject matter or so on?
Liron Segev: Love that, because I think that a lot of us would probably put a tick mark into, "Well, me as the audience member, did I receive the information I was looking for? Do I know how to make my Wi-Fi faster? Do I know how to get the best out of myself on camera?" The answer is probably, yes, because I've delivered enough value in the video. That's where it stops, brilliant.
Jordan Bower: On to R. R is about relationships. Relationships are the real reason we love to watch and we love to engage in any story, because as we all know, we're social animals. What we try to do as storytellers, is start a relationship between what we can call our characters and the audience, as quickly as possible. A subtle way to do that is, "Hey, I'm Jordan and I'm going to be introducing you to my toilet."
If you can give me a little bit more detail about the character, then it's going to be interesting and more fun for me to watch. Think of the difference between shooting a cell phone camera info video, in a white room by yourself, and shooting it in one of your favorite places in your house.
If you can create a relationship, not just with you, but also with the setting and the world around. What it does is, it transports us. Now, we're not just sitting alone in front of our computer or in front of our phone, consuming your information. We're literally there with you, in relationship with you as you're moving through stuff.
The strength of a relationship is what draws us all in. Relationships are like catnip to humans. The more you can tell us about the relationship, the more juicy the relationship is, the more we'll be hungry for it. Does that make sense?
Liron Segev: Does that mean that we have to give a little bit vulnerable, a little bit open and beyond just the content that we're trying to deliver, but also being ourselves? As opposed to acting a role?
Jordan Bower: Yeah, totally. Really putting the relationship first. Like you say, being vulnerable, it's so essential, because that's what we want as audiences. We don't just want the Google Maps voice talking to us. We want humanity, we want resonance, we want connection.
Liron Segev: Well, okay. Everyone, I just wanted to reiterate that point, because I think it's super, super important, so many people are still making that mistake - everything has to be a 100% perfect or it's a failed video.
That is such flawed thinking, because we're not all perfect. We all going to mumble, we all going to step over our own words. It's just natural. We would rather could make a connection with someone who's real, than an avatar or the Google Map voice. Love that.
Jordan Bower: Yeah, and I would say too, one last point on relationships is, don't underestimate that you have a relationship with your audience. You also define the terms of your relationship. Our first fear is, "Oh, we're going to get judged. These people are going to judge us."
When we're worried about other people's judgment, we're much more likely to be focused on the perfection. If we flip that on its head and say, "You know what? We want to give something to somebody. We're creators. We're bringing some creative product to the world. Something that no one else in the world has ever done before.
Only we can do it in our unique way." It's a gift. When we start to change our attitude about that, then we can become a little bit easier on ourselves as artists and creators.
__*Liron Segev: If you're trying to emulate somebody else, it's only going to get you to a certain level. People have already connected with that person. How can they connect with you? Why are you the best gaming channel? Why are you the best tech channel? Why would I choose you over thousands and thousands of other channels? It's because of you. That's what you bring to the party. __
Jordan Bower: My advice to you if you're someone who thinks like that, remember that every great artist started off in the same place you are right now. Like Michelangelo picked up sculpting hammer for the first time and had no idea what he was doing. Leonardo da Vinci, the same thing. Everybody starts from scratch. It's really important to love the process. What I would say is, find a favorite artist and learn about them.
Liron Segev: We've got the hook, we've got an audience, we've got relationships. What's the M?
Jordan Bower: M is Movement. What's really important to know, is that stories move. Imagine if I was a YouTube creator and I'm making a video, and the whole time I was talking in a monotone voice. Would you want to hear me talk for more than 10 seconds?
It's really important to remember that stories move. They move literally from start to finish, but they also move emotionally from start to finish. You'll see, if you go watch a movie, over the course of two hours, you're going to get all kinds of emotional experiences.
What we look for in good stories, is the diversity of emotional experiences. Even as you're starting to think about your video, how can you bring in different emotional elements? I would say, in the beginning, if you're just starting, just try to bring in one different emotional tone.
It's ironic. Like with the message, you want to be clear in your message, but with the emotions, you want to be experimental. You want to be creative. I remember when I was learning to be a photographer, that some of the advice I got was to change the angle that I was shooting at. The moment I start to go down and go up and move from side to side, I start to give myself a diversity of tools to work with. You're just doing something that breaks your habitual pattern. Now, over the years of being a storyteller, I've learned how to talk like a storyteller.
The emotion comes through, the passion, the pauses, all of that, all of that is totally learned. It doesn't mean it's inauthentic, but it's like something that I learned gradually, works with audiences. I want to be understood, I'm playing with these various tactics.
What I notice in workshops, is that when people tell their story, whether it's a story of how they became who they were or how they started their YouTube channel, they tend to tell it chronologically. It's like reading a police report.
Even just starting the story in a different place, is going to take you to a different level. Challenge yourself to tell the story in a different way. I already gave you a little bit of a hint of how to do this, in the first letter, which is hook. Look through the story and ask yourself, "What were the most emotionally impactful moments? When did something interesting happen?
When did I fail? When did I succeed? How do I tell a story where those are the main building blocks, as opposed to the chronology? My advice is, just experiment.
Liron Segev: All right, we've got a couple of more letters. We need to get on to the O now.
Jordan Bower: The O, is about Open. Open is a really interesting thing to think about stories, because you think like, "Hey, I've got a story to tell. I want it to have a point." As we talked about a little bit earlier, the best stories are open stories.
We love stories that have that feeling of openness. If you can find some way to make it more of an exploration or a creative experience, that draws us in. As audiences, we don't want to be lectured at. We want to be provoked with open questions that ask us to participate. Every great story is participatory. If a story isn't participatory, it's propaganda. Does that make sense?
Liron Segev: Again, we keep on going back to the unblock toilet for some reason. Once I know how to unblock my toilet, once I know how to get the best out of my camera on my phone, I will get the fastest internet at home. What else can I do to make them have that openness?
Jordan Bower: Well, let's think of the attitude you bring to your channel. If I was like, "Hey guys, I'm Jordan and I'm going to show you how to unblock your toilet." Like what I'm delivering to you is clear, but it's also very closed. If I was to say "Hey guys, I'm Jordan, the handyman. I am a home expert. No matter what goes wrong in your home for the rest of your life, I'll be able to help you with it. Whether it's your kitchen sink, whether it's the toilet, whether it's what to do with your leaves outside.
I'm the guy to go to, to help you with everything in your house. Today what we're going to do is, we're going to talk about the toilet." What I just did there, is I opened up who I am in the eyes of the audience.
Liron Segev: With YouTube, we were told specifically to follow a formula if you want to be successful." Whereas a lot of that needs to be unlearned now because the platform has changed. The algorithm has changed. The way people consume information has changed.
Jordan Bower: It's a really great way to roll into the N. H is Hook, A is Audience, R is Relationships. M is Movement, O is Open, N is Now. With now, it's all about thinking through how do you be relevant? How do you tell a story that's relevant to what your audience is experiencing now?
Again, going back to the, O, that's a great way to be open. Is now you're not just talking about your toilet, but you're Jordan, the handyman, who's helping give you life advice for what's happening in the world right now. Finding a way, and making sure that there is a way to link the story you want to tell, to what's happening in cultural context. That's so essential now because if you don't, somebody else will.
What does it mean to be a good storyteller? The world very clearly needs great storytellers right now. Developing the skill is so essential, not just to get people to watch your videos, as important as that is, but to also be leaders in your family, community and so on. Do not underestimate how impactful storytelling can be, throughout all aspects of your life, relationships too
Liron Segev: Tell us about Y
Jordan Bower: So Y is last. Again, a really nice segue. Y is You. Remember that, when it comes to any story, there are just three things that are happening. There's a human being telling a story to another human being. No matter whether you want to or not, you cannot escape the fact that your stories coming out of your mouth.
The moment that you are a storyteller, you cannot avoid being vulnerable. It's worth thinking through strategically, the level of vulnerability you want to bring. You don't need to bring it all, but you probably need to bring at least a little bit more than you're bringing right now.
The reason that we want to follow the people that we want to follow, is because we really want to connect to them as people. Maybe they're looking for a piece of information. Maybe they're lonely and looking for connection, and they're finding you.
Again, what we're looking for from you is humanity, is genuineness, is the kind of stumbles and failures that go with being human. That's the stuff of connection, It's nothing else. It's not fancy graphics. It's not fancy videos. It's not fancy technical stuff - we want you.
People want to connect. If you allow for that connection, that's what leads to viewership and success. Remember that, YouTube is new, but storytelling is the oldest profession on earth. The role of a storyteller is to help educate people.
As somebody who's taking on the role of being a storyteller, that's now your calling. "You're on stage, you're on camera. You're talking about things, people are going to invest emotionally in you. It's kind of par for the course. If you're going to play this game, you should expect that.
The more willingly you do it, and the more aware and consciously you do it, the more meaningful the connection. Which is going to lead to better audiences, and more views and all the other things that you want.
Liron Segev: Jordan, if you could post one tweet or one big billboard in the middle of Times Square, where every single creator will be able to see that message, what message would you give?
Jordan Bower: I think the most important skill that anyone can develop right now, is effective communication skills. I think it's great that you're learning how to do this with your audience.
Liron Segev: If people want to find you, how can they do that
Jordan Bower: My website isjordanbower.com. Right now, most of the work that I do is withorganizations. One of my ambitions for this year and the next is to start to develop a bit of a storytelling training school. If you're come now, before I have any of that stuff up, sign up for my newsletter, stay in touch and let's see what we can build together.
Liron Segev: Jordan, thank you very much.

Title: How to Get Your First 100 Subscribers as a YouTube Gaming Channel

How to Get Your First 100 Subscribers as a YouTube Gaming Channel
Although this post is all about gaming channels, the advice is applicable to all types of topics. However, check out our video on ‘How to Get Your First 100 Subscribers on YouTube’ for tips and tricks for every YouTube creator.
6 Ways to Get Your First 100 Subscribers as a YouTube Gaming Channel
How long have you been active on YouTube? And, in that time, how many subscribers have you gained on your channel? If you’re struggling to hit your first milestone then check out the following 6 tips for success
#1 Determine Your Value Proposition so Viewers Subscribe
As you can imagine, competition in the gaming space on YouTube is heavy. And as time goes on that competition is only going to increase as more and more gaming content creators are enticed onto the platform.

So as you continue on your YouTube journey towards that first 100 subscribers you need to ask yourself, why should people subscribe to me? And once you determine that, that needs to become your value proposition.
What’s a value proposition? It’s simply what makes your channel valuable, and if that's something you haven’t determined yet, that's my first assignment for you. Determine your value proposition and then make it clear upfront.
#2 Establish Your Authority as a Gamer
If you have less than 100 subscribers you need to build some credibility and authority around that value proposition.
You need to put your money where your mouth is and show us just exactly how you're going to help us master the game of Temtem, for instance. Luckily, you can do this in a multitude of ways. You could do tutorials, you could give your take on Temtem versus games like Pokemon, or you could show highlights of some of your best moments in the game where you conquered some of the most challenging boss fights.
But keep in mind, it takes time to build credibility and authority, and you're going to need a few videos under your belt before people start seeing that you actually are the master of Temtem.
This advice assumes that you've niched down your content to at least one genre of game if not one game altogether. We recently published a video on the subject and I highly recommend checking it out because I go over exactly how I would go about niching down into at least a genre of a video game.
#3 Create a Video Library of Content on Your YouTube Channel
Once you have decided which game or genre you’re going to focus on, I recommend building a healthy library of videos.
Even if your plan is just to make one video a week, I would recommend starting out with about three to five videos on the subject that you're covering. This will do a few things for you.
For one, it's going to help your potential subscribers know exactly what kind of content they're going to get if they come back wanting more. Secondly, you're giving YouTube more data to help better categorize your channel. The third thing this is going to do is give you the opportunity to diversify your content out of the gate.
Let's say you don't want to just make Temtem tutorials, but you also want to create some generic ‘let's play’ content where it's just you playing the game for 20 or 30 minutes. You can do a couple of ‘let's plays’, and mix in a tutorial and a review or two. Now your potential subscribers have a really good idea of what kind of videos you make around this game or the genre of games.
#4 Run a Channel Audit so You Know What’s Working
This seems like the perfect opportunity to show you theChannel Audit toolwe offer here at vidIQ. As you build up a library of videos, you're going to be getting a lot of data points, so run a channel audit often (even every day) and take a look at videos that are getting decent views, and decent engagement. Then, double down on that kind of content. Give your audience more of the things that they're coming back for.
You can also use this tool to determine videos that could use a little more work. You can go into these videos and determine why did people only watch for a short time, which is an amazing opportunity for you to learn from your old content and make more engaging videos going forward.
#5 Work Extra Hard on YouTube Custom Thumbnails
So you've picked your game or your genre and you know exactly what content to create to get you your first 100 subscribers because now you're giving them value on a very specific topic.
So with that out of the way, the next thing we need to focus on is your thumbnails. Generally speaking, I've seen countless creators do one of two things. First, they take a screenshot from the game and let that be their thumbnail. YouTube just chooses it for them and it very often doesn't really match the title of the video, so as a viewer and I'm not really sure what I'm going to get.
Secondly, I've seen a lot of over-produced thumbnails where creators try to cram as much text and tiny images into an already tiny thumbnail as possible in order to try and communicate what the video's about in just one little picture.
I can't stress enough, please don't skimp on your thumbnails. As gamers, we have a lot of awesome opportunities to make really colorful, eye-catching thumbnails because video games have already done half the work by basically allowing you to play in a work of art.
Now I do understand that some games make this a little more difficult than others. Like Temtem is a very visually appealing game, but what about a game like Braains.io? Braains.io is kind of a zoomed-out, top-down game and taking a screenshot and trying to make it a fun clickable thumbnail is a little bit tough, but a lot of creators have kind of found a way to make this work for them.
The fact of the matter is even if your game doesn't really allow for nice screenshots to be taken within it, be sure to put in that effort yourself and find a way to make your thumbnails clickable and eye-catching. Perhaps take a character from your game, and make it the hero of your thumbnail, but make sure that people visually connect with your game rather than just simply taking a top-down screenshot and calling it a day.
For more information on creating the perfect custom thumbnail (and why it’s vital that you do) check outour playlist here, which includes this invaluable advice:
#6 Remember Your Calls to Action
So up to this point, if you've been following this advice, you now have a strong value proposition, you have amazing thumbnails, you have a clear idea of exactly what your channel's about and you've communicated that to your audience. You're starting to build up that authority and that credibility by posting a number of videos that identify you as an expert on whatever it is you're covering.
Now that you've honed in on the value that you're offering your viewers, it never hurts to ask people to subscribe, I can't stress this enough.
Think of it this way, they've already clicked on your video out of interest. They saw your thumbnail and thought oh wow, that looks nice. They looked at the title and said, "Oh wow, I actually need to know "how to beat that boss fight in Temtem." Then they've clicked.
Now, let them know, you do this thing kind of a lot and you would like them to subscribe. When you watch videos here at vidIQ you'll notice that right at the bottom of the screen we always put something that indicates, hey, don't forget, you can subscribe. We make videos like this all the time. It never hurts to invite people to explore your library of videos a little bit deeper and decide if you're a creator they would like to visit again.
YouTube Gaming Channels: You’ve Got This!
Getting your first 100 subscribers on YouTube is probably going to be the hardest uphill battle you'll have on the platform. But once you get that first 100, you may find that 200 isn't far off because by now, you've built up a lot of credibility. You have a library of videos. You have an upload schedule and your audience is coming back for more.
YouTube is a marathon, not a sprint. So enjoy the time it takes to get your first 100 subscribers. Learn with every video you make and you'll get there, I promise.

Title: Will You Get More YouTube Views if You Upload Gaming Videos Every Day?

Will You Get More YouTube Views if You Upload Gaming Videos Every Day?
How often do you upload gameplay videos to your channel? In gaming, daily uploads are common, with creators maybe recording for a few hours, breaking that content up into smaller clips.
I've seen many reuploaded live streams broken up into several episodes, which gives the gamer ample content to upload every day. But is that the right strategy?
Building a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Upload Frequency
Now, the strategy of recording for a long time and then breaking it up and uploading segments of this recording every single day has its place on your gaming channel. But I've tried this for myself and I can tell you, if you're looking to grow your channel instead of just engage your current audience, this strategy isn't going to be very effective.

YouTube won’t necessarily reward you if you upload content as much as possible. If you're just uploading “episode 82” of your gameplay video, that's probably not a big search term that anyone is looking for.
Daily uploads do have the benefit of getting seen by your own audience because you've made that a schedule, and it's pretty easy to upload content every day when all you're doing is hitting record and just playing your favorite game. And for the bigger, more established channels, YouTube may just push your content because you're just uploading so many videos. But let me explain why smaller, newer channels should take a different approach.
Why Uploading Daily Gaming Content isn’t the Best Strategy
The first issue you're going to have is burnout. When I was doing this on my channel, I was trying to upload every single day. But not only did I get tired of the game fast, I got tired of all of it - editing the videos, creating thumbnails, trying to think of new titles and tags. It can just be too draining to make that much content all the time.
More importantly, it became harder and harder to come up with ideas about what I was going to do in every video. Even if it was a game like Minecraft where I'm building something, it doesn't take very long after about 50 days or 50 videos in to run out of things to build.
Combine all of those problems with the fact that my YouTube channel just simply wasn't growing made me look for a better solution.
The turning point for me was to cut back on the amount of content I made. Only then did I start to see progress. That's because instead of just making content as often as I could, I took a step back and asked myself, "What are people who play Minecraft really searching for? What are the problem areas? So adopting that quality over quantity method helped me grow, and that was a huge learning curve for my channel.
Now, as someone who started a gaming channel, I, like many of you had somebody or a few people I was watching who inspired me to keep creating. I would watch their channels as a fan and I would see them uploading every day and I would see their videos getting thousands of views and it made me excited.
However, usingvidIQ’s Competitor toolI could really understand what is making those other gaming channels work. The tool allows you to choose any channel you want and check out how their videos are doing based on views per hour, views in general, or just the date uploaded.
The reason I've picked these very large Minecraft creators relative to the size of my own channel, is because they appear top for the search term Minecraft. These are well-established creators who can get almost 20,000 views every hour on a video that was posted two days ago, but even they still need to be putting in that quality work.
You'll notice that a lot of time has been spent on their very custom thumbnails. These are not screenshots taken from Minecraft, these are handcrafted, custom thumbnails that are all very eye-catching, and have a lot of color to them.
There's one specific channel I want to point out that does a really good job though and that isPixlriffs. The thumbnails are pretty nice. They are screenshots from the game and they simply say Minecraft and then what it is. SkyBlock, The Survival Guide and so on.
What's cool about this channel is everything is still part of an ongoing series. There’s a series about SkyBlock, but specifically going to the nether in SkyBlock, which is going to be a term viewers are searching for.
What Pixlriffs tends to do is stay within that same Minecraft world. So in effect, these are still, let's play videos as you may know them, as you might create for yourself, but they all have a purpose.
The point of me showing you this is on this channel, everybody's happy. Pixlriffs is making content that's probably going to get him discovered by a new audience and his current audience gets to watch as he plays Minecraft and progresses through the game.
Why Bigger YouTube Gaming Channels Can Upload Every Day
Now, these creators all have pretty large audiences. They also have great custom thumbnails and titles, and a lot of time and effort has been put into optimizing their content. You'll also notice that they have a pretty high upload frequency, they upload quite often, but what is important to remember when looking at your competition, especially when you try to compare yourself to larger channels, is that these channels are a lot more established than my own.
Some of them are doing this as a full-time job, some of them even have teams of people helping them with new thumbnails, editing, and research, etc.
As a new smaller channel, this is definitely a struggle I had. I had to remind myself that I have to start somewhere. I can't come out of the gate at the same level as these other creators. Even if I know I can make quality videos as nice as theirs, I can't do that every single day without quitting my day job or hiring a bunch of people to help me. I'm not saying that's what you have to do to get to this level. I'm just saying for me at the time, that's what I've struggled with.
YouTube Success: Quality Over Quantity
All of our journeys are different. Mine is going to be different from yours, and from other creators, but one thing we all have one thing in common and that's every single YouTube channel starts with zero subscribers.
They start by asking their friends to subscribe and they test things out and then they slowly grow over time. Some of the big creators have been around for quite some time and that also gives them an advantage in the Minecraft space.
The point is if I want to grow as a Minecraft channel today, I'm going to have to try a whole lot harder because a lot of those questions that people are searching for are being answered already. There are a lot of competitors who are already covering those topics.
So when I say quality over quantity, it's especially important to remember that depending on the game you're playing and just how popular it is.
So do daily uploads help grow your channel on YouTube? Yeah, absolutely. If you can upload one video a day and you've put in the time, and the research, including creating an awesome thumbnail, an awesome title, awesome tags, and you've done everything you can to make sure that video is as high quality as possible. If you can do all of this, then go for it.
But if you don't have time to do all that work. I would highly recommend instead of daily uploads, perhaps just publish one or two videos a week. This is going to give you time in between videos to come up with those ideas to make a nice handcrafted thumbnail or to really research your keywords and titles
The key is to be consistent with your publishing schedule. You want to make sure that you upload videos frequently enough so your audience is used to finding them and YouTube is used to knowing when it should push your videos because you've uploaded them at the same time consistently week after week.
So say you upload your one or two videos a week and you find yourself with some extra downtime and you think, "Oh, that Dan guy's totally wrong. I want to make daily videos." I still think that's totally cool because as you make those more searchable, high-quality videos, you're going to want to maybe put some more out there for your audience to watch that has already subscribed, has already decided they like you.
There's nothing wrong with posting a regular old gameplay video every day, but the main take away for you is that quality over quantity is going to help with the overall growth of your channel to bring in those new subscribers.

Title: How to Start a Successful Gaming Channel like PewDiePie

How to Start a Successful Gaming Channel like PewDiePie
Many gamers on YouTube were inspired by other gaming creators. And the first creators we discover are often the ones that are well established on the platform and seem to be able to play any kind of video game they want.
So with that in mind, starting a gaming channel and playing whatever you like seems pretty easy, right? I mean, there are millions of gaming channels with billions of views so why shouldn’t your channel be just as successful?
Why PewDiePie Can Do What He Likes on YouTube
One creator in particular, has inspired a huge number of gamers - Felix Kjellberg, AKAPewDiePie.

In a recent video, all about how to start a YouTube gaming channel, I discussed how to grow your views and subscribers by narrowing down your niche to just one video game. A lot of YouTubers responded by stating they wanted to play multiple games within multiple genres on their channels and still grow. One comment on that video really stood out to me. The commenter asked:
Something really clicked with me when I read this comment. And I realized why so many new gaming channels seem to be all over the place when it comes to their coverage of games and different genres.
A lot of gamers think if it's good enough for PewDiePie, it's good enough for me. And that mentality may be actually a pretty good way to start a YouTube channel because you have to start somewhere, and you're going to need some practice. But trying to follow in PewDiePie's footsteps in 2020 is a different matter.
How PewDiePie Went From Zero Subscribers to 103M
What if I told you that PewDiePie once had zero subscribers. He started his channel in 2010 playing primarily horror and action video games and was so popular he reached his first 1 million subscribers in July of 2012. If we take a look at some of his older videos from around nine years ago, you see PewDiePie probably had a pretty familiar journey playing around with various games on his channel until he got into Amnesia, and never really looked back. Horror games were PewDiePie's bread and butter.
Let's take a look at another creator’s journey.Markiplieris currently at 25 million subscribers, and if we're sorting by the very oldest videos on his channel, he was also playing a lot of horror games at the beginning. He was exploring a niche while testing out other games. Some of these videos have custom thumbnails, some of them do not.
Jacksepticeye, now with 23 million subscribers was playing a lot of first-person shooters in the beginning. That's how he got his start on YouTube - this was his third upload way back in 2013:
These are some of the biggest names in gaming today and they got their start just like us with zero subscribers, testing out different content, staying within their niche and growing from there.
How to Find Your Way on YouTube as a Gamer
For those of you with gaming channels, I have a strategy I want to share with you for finding your way. I want you to know that if you still struggle to figure out exactly what you would like to play on your channel, it's okay to start testing by playing some different games. These videos can be great practice if you are just getting started on YouTube. You should also be working on your titles, tags, thumbnails, and descriptions of course.
If you're playing different games at some point you’re going to find one game, or even one genre attracts more views and engagements than your other content. That's when I want you to pounce and double down on that game.
As long as you played the game with the intention of hopefully making more videos around it, which I would imagine you did, this strategy is going to grow your channel a lot faster than if you continue just playing random games and ignoring those moments when things kind of stick.
It happened to me. I was inspired to start making videos on Minecraft by watching other Minecraft content creators. But one day I was gifted a new survival game that had a lot of the same aspects; build, mine, craft. I tried it out and I put it on my channel, and that video got more views than anything else I had published previously. It blew up, so I did about 30 or 50 videos on it.
I still wanted to make Minecraft videos from time to time and I did, but for the most part, this other game was driving the growth of my channel and I always made sure to have new episodes out all the time.
Find Out What Gaming Content is Trending
Now I got lucky because that game was a gift from just a friend of mine and played it and it worked out, but a lot of you aren't going to have the same luck.
However, you can use tools likevidIQ’s Trend Alertsto look for new games to test out on your channel. Start by testing out different keywords and key phrases around your genre. Let's say your genre is building survival crafting games like Minecraft, but you don't want to play Minecraft itself. So just type in “survival game”, switch your category to gaming, add your competitors, then choose your view per hour threshold. The Trend Alerts tool will also send you emails to keep you up to date. Ideally, you want to pick competitors that are closer to your level of subscribers, and channel views, etc.
Many, or I would argue probably most. gaming YouTubers start a channel and they don't know where it's going to go, what they're going to play, or even for how long. Unless you already know that it's okay to test out different games and we want to encourage you to double down when one of those games becomes a viral success on your channel. I use the word viral loosely because that success is relative to how other videos have performed on your channel.

Title: How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube

How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube
Making content around video games on YouTube has to be some of the most fun you can have on the platform, but getting discovered, maybe not so much.
It's not going to be as easy as hitting record on your next Minecraft building session or wiping the floor with everybody in Fortnite. So the purpose of this post is to help you get discovered on YouTube playing games in 2020.
6 Tips for Starting a Gaming Channel on YouTube
But even if you don't have a gaming channel, don't fret because a lot of this advice I can be applied to several different genres of video on YouTube!

#1 Gaming Channels on YouTube: Find YOUR Niche
Let's first discuss the types of gaming content getting discovered in gaming in 2020. In order to figure that out, we have to ask ourselves, well, what is YouTube? Ultimately, YouTube is a search engine. Now, that may seem obvious, but have you ever made a video titled Bob plays Minecraft episode 12? That's what I'm talking about. Nobody is going to search for the words Bob plays Minecraft episode 12, and the next thing we have to ask ourselves is, well, what are we doing with search engines?
And the answer is answering questions. Whenever we think of something we need to know, we type it into YouTube and try and find a video that's going to answer that question or cover that need. Perhaps it's just to find something funny to watch to get you through your lunch break. With that in mind, the types of content that I want you to be focused on when trying to get discovered in gaming on YouTube would be tips and tricks, reviews, tutorials. Like this one:
Cover a glitch that you found in a game or an Easter egg that you found. Maybe nobody else has found it. The next time the game you're playing has some DLC that drops, pick it up right away, review it, and let people know if they should spend their money on it. Maybe you bought it and it was a terrible mistake, but that's a great video right there.
#2 Find Ideas for YouTube Gaming Content
If you're struggling to come up with ideas on what you could be covering around your game, check outVidIQ's 'Most Viewed' tool. Type a search in for the game you're playing, and see what people are watching in real-time. What videos are getting the most views right now?
Not only will this help you figure out what your competition's doing, but it'll also help you figure out what questions people may be asking about your game which brings me to the second topic we need to cover, and that is focusing your channel on just one game.
#3 Get Laser-Focused on One Video Game
The best thing you can do for your channel is to become an authority on the game you're playing. If you like to play Call of Duty, then you need to be making Call of Duty videos so YouTube views you as the Call of Duty authority. The more videos you make on one game, the more data YouTube has to focus on when it's trying to figure out what videos to recommend to people when they type in Call of Duty.
Now, for a lot of gaming channels, that's a huge ask. Hey, one game per channel, that's it. If you don't want to make a new channel every time you play a new game I totally understand, and there are plenty of examples of people who didn't have to make a new channel whenever they played a game that they don't normally play. However, I want to stress two things:
#4 Keep a Close Eye on Your Competitors
If you're playing a game that's relatively popular and you're just having some trouble coming up with ideas, maybe check outvidIQ's Competitor’s Tool.
Type in specific channels and see how other people are covering the games that you're covering. Based on how your competitors' videos are doing, you're probably gonna get some good insights into what you should be doing next.
#5 Don’t Upload a Single Gaming Video Without Doing the Work
The next thing we need to address is upload frequency. It is tempting, especially in gaming, to record hours on end of content and break it up into several videos so you have something every single day, and I understand that temptation. However, don't do that.
Since we already have you thinking about making tutorials and reviews, those videos are going to take time, and I would highly recommend spending that time crafting each video to perfection.
Make sure yourYouTube custom thumbnail is on point, make sure your titles are researched as are your tags and your description. Do the work because that's going to pay off.
Every new video that you post is going to be a new opportunity for somebody new to discover you, so make sure every video is helpful to that end. If you would like to play a game through, make a long-term let's play series, that's okay, but I want you to do that knowing that what you're doing is helping your current audience stay engaged, which there's nothing wrong with doing that, but it does take time away from crafting those more discoverable, searchable videos.
#6 Become an Active Part of the Gaming Community
So, I've told you to stick to one game. Do tutorials, do reviews, and try not to upload ‘Let's Plays’ every single day, but how do we expand and how do we discover different types of content we can make to not only keep our audience engaged, but keep us engaged with the game as well?
And that's where the community comes in around a game. When covering games on YouTube, try to immerse yourself in the community around it. If the game has a modding community, that's great. You can make a video that just kind of showcases different mods every week. If it's a building game like Minecraft, try and find servers that feature amazing builds. Tour them, show people new things they've never seen before.
You'll find once you're discovering different communities within a game that people are creating challenges and playing the game in ways that no one ever imagined. Try to do one of those challenges on your channel or better yet, come up with a way to play your game that no one's thought of before and you make the challenge for someone else to do.
The easiest way to grow any channel on YouTube is to provide value. Although it's tempting to record four hours of gameplay footage and break it up into eight 30-minute videos, that's not going to get you discovered.
Become an expert in your game and answer the questions that people are searching for around it.

Title: How to Start a Gaming Channel On YouTube The RIGHT Way!

How to Start a Gaming Channel On YouTube The RIGHT Way!
We recently published a video and a post aroundstarting a YouTube gaming channel in 2020, and in that video, I discussed playing just one game. But what if you don't know what game to play? What if you don't know which is the one game for you? This method could help you find out exactly what that could be.
Wait. I just spent all that time telling you to play one game, and now I'm telling you maybe there's another way. Just hold on. I still think sticking to one game is a good strategy, but what if you play lots of different games? What if you play games that have to be kind of similar?
The Benefits of Sticking to One Genre on Your YouTube Gaming Channel
Let's first discuss why it's important to play one game in a lot of cases. And, mainly it's because YouTube is going to understand what your channel is about. That will lead to the platform suggesting your videos among creators who make kind of the same stuff, and among search results for people who are looking for that content.

So, if you play Stardew Valley, then you want YouTube to recommend your videos when someone types in "Stardew Valley." But if you play Stardew Valley and a hundred other games, YouTube doesn't really know where you're at, and it's going to be a little bit harder for the service to put your videos out there for people searching for Stardew Valley.
Now if that sounds like something you're doing right now, let's talk about narrowing down your content a little bit. Let's not dive right into one game so fast. What if we at least dive into a genre? What is Stardew Valley? Stardew Valley is a couple of things. I consider it a farming game, or an RPG.
For hypothetical purposes, let's focus on farming. I like farming games! I like Stardew Valley, I like Farming Simulator, I like games that feature farming. So let's just say that my channel is going to be a farming game channel. Now, that's pretty specific, right? There's probably not a lot of channels that just focus on that one type of game.
Even if you don't play Stardew Valley, you might be thinking to yourself, "Okay, I don't like farming games at all, "but I do like to play a lot of Call of Duty, "so what does a strategy for that look like for me?"
COD is a first-person shooter game, so, now that we know that, now that you have your genre, here's what I suggest doing: Take that game that you like, take that genre that you like, pick one of the games out of it, and go in, and make five videos on it. Make ten videos. Make as many as you're comfortable making.
After you publish ten videos on one game, you're probably going to come away with some pretty decent stats, which is good. Data is always good for testing purposes like we're about to, you know, theoretically do.
So for me, that game happened to be Stardew Valley. Let's say I make ten Stardew Valley videos, and I'm like "Okay, I finished the Community Center, "and I got a bunch of money, "and I'm pretty happy with my progress in Stardew, "I'm kind of tired of it right now. "I'm going to swap over. "I'm going to make ten videos on Farming Simulator."
Now, after every Farming Simulator video I post, I'm going to be looking to see what my numbers are doing, and how my audience is responding to that content. In the comments, are they saying, "Aw man, I really miss Stardew Valley"? Hey, it's still good that they showed up, right? They like you, they're watching your Farming Simulator video and they came in to say, "Yeah, I kinda liked Stardew better," but at least they came in! Maybe they'll stick around, maybe they enjoy the farming games as much as you do. Or maybe you notice a whole bunch of people commenting on your video that weren't there before! Hey, okay! People really like this Farming Simulator game.
I know I'm just using two games as an example, I'd probably recommend trying this with a wider spread of farming games in this case, but I just happen to really like these two farming games, and if I'm being honest, there's not a lot of farming games that I really play. So, maybe not a perfect example. But, play as many games as you need to play in your genre.
If it's MMORPGs, then play the various MMOs that you like to play. If it happens to be first-person shooters, play those. If it happens to be games like Minecraft, survival games, building games, play as many as you can get your hands on that you'll enjoy. The most important thing is to upload these videos regularly. So, I want to stick to a schedule, and I want to upload games that are at least similar to one another.
Know Your Gaming Genre and Find New Opportunities
So I've hypothetically made my videos about Stardew Valley, I got tired of it, I made my videos about Farming Simulator, and I'm noticing some trends. Let's take a look at this.
Now obviously I didn't record any Stardew Valley or Farming Simulator videos, these are all kind of hypotheticals to get you thinking. But let's just say I did. What I want to know is what's going on in Farming Simulator? All right, so if you were to record farming simulator videos you'll see that your volume and competition look pretty good. This is actually a pretty decent search term - but is it though?
There's a lot of people playing Farming Simulator on YouTube, what if playing Farming Simulator won’t get me discovered? What if it's the word "simulator" that’s the key?
As somebody who plays a lot of games, I know that the simulator genre is actually really popular. Competition is pretty high, but there's a high search volume for people looking for the word "simulator".
Now, what have I just discovered about my content? So far as I can tell, this is not a bad idea! What if people like simulator games as much as they like farming games? What I've just done is given myself an opportunity to explore a whole genre of games that I didn't even think of at first!
Now don't get me wrong, I know this is a very specific example. We're talking about farming games, now we're talking about simulator games, and if this isn't anywhere near your genre, just know that there's a lot of different ways we can categorize games.
Games are cool because they have more than one genre, they're more than one thing a lot of times. Take Fallout, for example. Fallout 4, you could argue it's a first-person shooter game, but you could also argue, because it has a currency system built in it, and quests, it's actually an RPG. So as you're playing Fallout 4 on your channel and you're starting to get kind of tired of it, what if you played another RPG?
What if you were tired of first-person shooters at that point, but you thought, "Man, I could really go for some "Stardew Valley!" Well, Stardew Valley isn't just a farming game, it's an RPG. It has a currency system, it has quests you can do, and in some ways, Stardew Valley is similar to Fallout 4, believe it or not.
Niche Down on Your Gaming Genre
So by now, I assume you kind of get it, right? You don't have to play just one game on your channel, you could be playing all these random games. And people might ask you, "Why do you play so many random games?" And you can go, "I don't play random games. "I play simulator games! "I play Farming Simulator, I play Truck Simulator, "I play Thief Simulator." These are now your genre. Now you are the authority on simulator games.
But for those of you sitting there going, "Okay, but I actually kind of like playing just one game, "I was on board with your last plan, "what are you doing to me, you're driving me crazy!" And to those of you who are thinking that, I want to say, there is always an opportunity to niche down your content and be just the Truck Simulator person.
Or, let's say you feel like Farming Simulator has so much more depth than all the other simulator games, and that's all you want to play from now on, that's probably a smart move if your audience has really been taking to it very well. Maybe, if you're lucky, Farming Simulator has some of the best views on your channel and that's more of a reason to just stick to that one game.
The point is, there's no wrong way to do this, and every channel is going to be different, and there's never one secret sauce that I can give you that's going to work for everybody watching. I just want to get you thinking. I just want you to think about games in terms of genre.
Maybe that is a way for you to play multiple games, or at the very least test to see which one game happens to be the best for you. We talk a lot here on this channel about getting discovered, a lot of our videos and advice is to that end. You want to be discovered by people out there on YouTube, looking for things.
But when we're talking about video games, it's even more important to stress this one thing: Please play games you actually enjoy. The most important thing that you can do on a gaming channel is to play games that you enjoy, because your audience is going to sense when you're not invested in the game, and in turn, they won't be invested in your video.
So to those of you out there playing games and trying to find yourselves on YouTube, I hope this was helpful. I hope I managed to kind of enlighten you to a new strategy or two for finding not only your game but your audience.

How to Build an Engaged & Loyal YouTube Community: TubeTalk 190 with QuHarrison Terry
When you look at the big YouTube channels, there's one thing that they all have in common. They all have an amazing community or fan base. That means that as soon as a new video is launched their fans are the first to comment or the first to watch or the first to share. You have to focus on building up your community if you stand any chance of success on YouTube.
The mistake that a lot of us make is that we only use the tools that YouTube provides. In other words, we use thecommunity posts, or we reply to comments, and that's pretty much it. So today we're going to focus on using multiple tools to build a communication channel between you and your audience because that is how you grow your own YouTube channel.
So, how do you build that one on one relationship and engagement with your audience? I put that question toQuHarrison Terry, Growth Marketer at for Mark Cuban’s group of companies. Now you all know Mark Cuban - he’s a venture capitalist, and he's also one of the sharks on an amazing show called ‘Shark Tank’, where he invests in certain companies that he believes in. But once the show is over, once the due diligence has been done, and once Mark and his team really get to grips with that company to help them grow, QuHarrison steps in and helps with those communications, helps with their strategy, helps with their growth.

Now QuHarrison himself has been a founder of several companies, especially in the high tech space, from an advertising agency, specializing in marketing to millennials, to a healthcare data exchange platform, the world's first digital art marketplace powered by blockchain, so plenty of experience in growth and community building.

Liron Segev: As content creators, we are out there, we're delivering our content, we're getting views, we're getting likes, we're getting subscribes, we're getting comments. Surely that's enough, no?
QuHarrison Terry:	I think it's enough for some, but if you're serious about this and you want to make this a full time job or a serious stream of revenue, you have to kind of treat it like a business. And in that regard, what business do you know that succeeds that doesn't serve their customers? And in serving your customers, you can't serve them if you don't talk to them, right? You have to talk and listen to them and then modify your product ideally, and now you have a business.
Liron Segev:	So, the two way communication. We're looking at it saying, "Okay, well we're behind the camera, we press record, we upload onto the platform, we're pretty much done. Maybe we'll do a bit of social media, but technically we're done." You're saying then, we're going about this the wrong way around?
QuHarrison Terry:	Yes, yes, yes. I'm thinking you created a product, but you only get a portion of what's really out there if you only look at the metrics that are given to you from a platform like YouTube, right?
A lot of those metrics are great for YouTube, and they could be great for you in certain situations, but in most situations they're not telling you the full picture. Like if someone came to your video and watched it just because they did a simple search, that doesn't mean they know your brand. That doesn't mean they know you, but it is an opportunity for them to get to know you. And how do you continue that conversation after they've watched or received the information they had?
Liron Segev:	Okay, so you've hit on a couple of very important key points here. So, first of all you mentioned they don't know your brand. Do you think that YouTubers, content creators as a whole, are maybe not thinking of themselves as being a brand?
QuHarrison Terry: I think at a later stage it becomes almost impossible to not see yourself as a brand. When you have 500,000 subscribers or a million subscribers, you're a brand. You're a household name in some places, right?
When you're just starting out, it's really hard to see yourself as a brand when it's just you and your friends at home, your family that check out your content, and so I think it's a perception that changes over time. But to answer your question, I think everyone should look at themselves as a brand if they want to not passively create content, but actively do it.
So if you're seriously just considering starting a channel or already have a channel and you're taking it serious in the sense of it's fun, it's just something you do in your past time but you enjoy it, then yes, it's a brand of some sorts, right? Even if you do it and this is like your full time gig, it's a brand, and you have to treat it almost as if it were a real brand. Whether that be a company, a business or an organization, because the brand is key.
Liron Segev:	Well, and the brand is you. I mean, at the end of the day it's your that's out there. And you want it to be top of mind when people think, "Hey, I need to have a good laugh today. I'm having a really bad day. Who's my favorite YouTuber?" You need to be that person, that destination. My toilet is clogged. Who do I go see? You know?
QuHarrison Terry:	Yeah, that's true.
Liron Segev:	So being top of mind means essentially creating a brand. Do you advise content creators to think as a business even when they're small?
QuHarrison Terry:	Yes, yes, undoubtedly. I think that even in this conversation, when we talk about brands and what it means to be a brand or if you should consider yourself as a brand, that can be very daunting. Right?
I imagine if I were just trying to get content out the door, that might actually prevent me from creating content if I started to think about a brand and me as a brand and how that should function, because there's a lot of tough questions that you run into when you start to think of yourself as a brand.
So, the prerequisite I would put on the whole consideration of considering yourself as a brand would be think about it, but don't let it paralyze you. Acknowledge it, but don't let it be the end all.
Liron Segev:	Right. And not responding to the analysis paralysis. I need to get everything absolutely perfect, otherwise I'm never going to press that record button. Well, that's going to stop you from ever pressing the record button, right?
QuHarrison Terry:	Correct, because some of the people with the best brands don't make a lot of content. I mean, look at Beyonce. She's a great example. Beyonce doesn't run around always making content, following the nine tips you need to do on Instagram or YouTube to grow an audience, but she has an impeccable brand.
Now you can say she did a lot of things in a prior history or timeline before social media really existed, but the key point I'm trying to make here is a brand is something that co-exists alongside your efforts and actions.
She put definitely the time into becoming an artist and sharing her art, and that basically paid off dividends and turned into the massive brand that she has today.
Liron Segev:	And at the end of the day, it's still about the content. Even if you don't have everything nailed perfectly but it's still good content, people are going to watch.
QuHarrison Terry:	Correct.
Liron Segev:	You're going to build an audience because you're giving them value. You're giving them something for their time, which is awesome. All right, so that was the one point I wanted to pick up on the brand. Hey, communicate with your audience. Let's dive into that, because that is really impactful. I see a lot of content creators saying, "Okay, I've uploaded my video, I've uploaded to YouTube or to Instagram, whatever the platform may be. I've engaged with people in the comments. Well, I've done my job." Put a little tick box and move onto the next video. Are they wrong?
QuHarrison Terry:	No, they're not wrong. I mean, would you think they're wrong?
Liron Segev:	Well, I would think that there's different levels of communications based on different levels, right? But I do think that you can carry that conversation way beyond just a reply to a comment.
QuHarrison Terry:	I would totally agree with that. I think there's a lot of examples there, but for the people that commonly think about like what does communication on the platform and off the platform look like, I see so many people just default to email. The thing about that is I think it's the lazy way of communicating with your customers.
I've got an email newsletter and I've got a paid newsletter, right? I understand email and I cherish it as a channel, but I also do see how it is a lazy mechanism for people to talk with their customers, especially if you have a younger audience, right?
So one thing I would do is I would look at my YouTube data, and I would look at where do people, one, consume my content? If people are consuming my content and watching my videos on mobile, well that's a great metric. I probably would much rather show up in an iMessage, a text message, a Slack or Discord.
If you're consuming me on desktop, then maybe something like a survey or an email or a Chatbot experience might work better. Right? And I think to your broader point with there being levels to the dialogue at which you can converse with your viewers, I would say there's some good examples out there already.
When I watch Jared Polin's videos, Fro Knows Photo, he's a YouTuber, he makes a lot of content breaking down the schematics of cameras and how they intertwine into a creator's life, and he gives a lot of how-to guides, a lot of actions. He's the guy I go to when I want to know all the settings on a device related to photography and videography. His channel is very unique, because he's got over a million subs. He can't really respond to all the comments because of just the volume.
And with that being known, what he's done is he's built some pretty interesting funnels. He sends everyone back, for the most part, to froknowsphoto.com, and then there's different offers for different people. So he has the email newsletter, he has the discount if you just want something right then and there. He has a tutorials, of course. He even has courses, right?
I think that ecosystem that he's built is very much a heavy lift. If someone were to start today and they were just getting started, I would not say, "Go make froknowsphoto.com," but I would say definitely learn from it, right? And just say, "Hey, I really like how he sends everyone to this one destination. And that destination can be a plethora of things, but the one thing you do need to do is get information from the viewer. Whether that be a name, an email, a phone number, and then you need to continue that conversation."
Liron Segev:	And the most important thing here is owning that relationship.
QuHarrison Terry:	Yes.
Liron Segev:	The one thing that, as much as we love YouTube, at the end of the day we only have a subscriber, name, and a number, and it's not a telephone number, it's just a number of subscribers. If we want to send out a message to say, "Hey, we're going live tomorrow," there really isn't a way to do that. You're relying on YouTube notifications for all of those.
What he is doing is very smart. He's owning the relationships by building up a mailing list, by building up a call list, by getting people to opt in. That is actually absolute gold. Content creators of smaller sizes could maybe not do everything, but maybe they should focus on building up one channel of communication, give away something, give away a free ebook. Maybe is that a good place to start?
QuHarrison Terry:	Yeah, totally. Even if you've given away time. It's not scalable, but if I were starting off and you are inspiring or helping people, make yourself available, even if it's just 30 minutes a day, and you can pick the channel.
I've seen people do lives on Twitter and Instagram. I've seen people do things on LinkedIn. I've seen people do things via email, right? I mean even Gary Vee, you've seen him just give away his phone number. He's like, "Shoot me a text message."
Liron Segev:	How simple is it to pick up your phone and say, "Okay, go live on Instagram," and say, "I'm going to answer your questions for the next 30 minutes. Come and hang out."
QuHarrison Terry:	Right, and the first initial sessions are probably going to be quite dry, there's not going to be a lot of people.
Liron Segev:	But that's a good thing though. You can practice.
QuHarrison Terry:	It's true. That's true.
Liron Segev:	Do you find that YouTubers as they start to grow and build, they're realizing that, "Hold on, this stuff costs money. I need to be able to fund this somehow."
QuHarrison Terry:	Totally. Totally. Because your time is money, right? It's the one thing that's not scalable. A lot of people trade hours for money, and that's like their job, right? And some people are YouTube creators and they can create content, and they put a lot of time into their content, and then they trade that content for monetization of some type, whether it be a brand deal, whether it be advertising or affiliate dollars. And knowing that your time is the most valuable asset you'll have, yeah, you need to take this seriously and monetize it to some extent.
I think owning that communication channel with your customers alleviates you from relying on certain platforms too much. Obviously you need those platforms to reach everyone and reach the masses, but if you've got ... Kevin Kelly, he's got a really good theory on this on 1000 True Fans. If you're interested in knowing why it's important to own the relationship, I'd recommend readingKevin Kelly's 1000 True Fans theory. I'm not going to cover it here. That could be its own episode.
Liron Segev:	I've just readPat Flynn's Superfansbook, as well. He talks about exactly the same thing, that once you have fans and they know you and they get to kind of think a one-on-one relationship with you, it's amazing how many doors that unlocks for you. You might not be thinking about that right now. Maybe you're thinking I'm too small, maybe it's only my friends and family that watch it, but if you can start building your mindset and around that and start thinking of this as a business, that transition will be so smooth as you're growing bigger and bigger and bigger versus trying to just shove something down at a later stage.
QuHarrison Terry:	Right. I think a lot of people too, when you're just starting out and on this journey of trying to communicate with people, you might not see the benefit right away.
Liron Segev:	Yeah, absolutely. Like, I'm commenting back. That's pretty much as good as an email.
QuHarrison Terry:	Right, right. And you're like, "Well, I don't know. I put a lot of energy and time in this, and I didn't get anything out." I think it's a rolling 90-day period. You have to assess your efforts over a 90-day period. Consistently put up shots for 90-days. A shot could be shooting an email, sending a tweet, sending a text, making yourself available, and see what works, and then go back and reassess where your time is actually valuable spent.
Liron Segev:	And it's okay to fail.
QuHarrison Terry:	Yes.
Liron Segev:	I mean, certain things are just simply not going to work with your audience. You've got to be okay with that. Not everything's going to be a slam dunk. I have to use a Maverick term. Not everything's going to be a slam dunk right out of the gate. You're going to have to experiment and see what works for you and what works for your audience as well.
QuHarrison Terry:	That's the journey.
Liron Segev:	That's the journey. I do like the point, and this is actually a super point what you made about if your audience is from mobile, speak to them in a mobile first environment.
QuHarrison Terry:	Yes.
Liron Segev:	You mentioned some of the tools and we went through them very quickly, so it's worthwhile mentioning again. What kind of tools would you suggest on mobile phones?
QuHarrison Terry:	So on mobile phones, if I had an audience and my YouTube data told me 50% or 69% of my viewers were coming from that channel, I would definitely try iMessage business chat, right? That's something that's been underutilized, but really what Apple did is they opened up an API and they allow anyone with a business to send a message as an iMessage directly to phones. That's really cool. And then that would be an angle, SMS would be an angle.
I think another angle I would go is overly sharing my Snap code or my social tags. Not just in the description, but I would better incorporate them into the mobile experience. So like maybe I say, "If you're watching this in the first week, I've added it to my snap story and it will be in my featured highlights." Right?
I would get creative knowing that you're not going to get someone to go from their phone to their desktop computer and do a checkout process right away. In some cases you could, but what you could do is get them to go to something that they're going to do intrinsically in mobile. And the social media apps that are more personal and ephemeral really only take place on your mobile phone.
Liron Segev:	No, but that's great, incorporating that messaging into maybe your outro as you're ending up your video. So, "Hey guys, after this I'll be sharing some behind the scenes, maybe on my Instagram or maybe on my Snapchat, and here is a link. Go and make sure that talk to each other there. I'm usually available for quick chats there, too." Drive the audience actively. Don't expect them to find you.
QuHarrison Terry:	Potato Jet does a great job of that. At the end of his videos what he does is he's like, "Hey, what'd you think? Did you like this video? You like the color orange background? You like this lens?", and then he tells people to chat in the comments. But he's super active in the comments, right? So he does it right on the platform, and I think people can do that too, but if you want to take it off the platform and build up an audience elsewhere, it's not a problem to to try that out as well.
Liron Segev:	And it's okay to get weird.
QuHarrison Terry:	Of course.
Liron Segev:	I mean, you don't have to follow one thing. Try it, evaluate, did it work? Yes or no? If it did, do you have to tweak it? Yes or no? And then rinse and repeat until you found a formula that absolutely works. As you keep on saying, "we have to measure, measure, measure." Any tips on what we should be looking out for?
QuHarrison Terry:	Let's say I had a YouTube channel and I had a dashboard, what I would do is I would go into my YouTube dashboard, I would look at the different types of viewers that I have and where they're coming from. More specifically, are they desktop, are they web-based, mobile, are they video game consoles? Because that that could be interesting. I'm sure there's some channels if you're a streamer, you probably have a large percentage of people that are viewing you from a gaming device or a console.
Liron Segev:	Ooh, I like that. It makes sense.
QuHarrison Terry:	Yeah, and in that case that's a different experience because that's a shared screen experience, right? You have their phone which is free, they're watching on a TV, and then in some cases people have different monitors going because they're playing video games, right? So you can capture two other screens in addition to the screen that you have. And so that would be the first step, is I'd figure out where is my audience when they're watching my content?
Liron Segev:	Don't be scared of your analytics. Go and investigate that. Going to your demographics, go into your sources. One thing that we always glance over, we assume everybody is coming from the US or they're all English speaking. You'll find that India is a very, very big player on YouTube. Could you leverage that as well? Could you create something around those contents as well? Don't be scared of your analytics.
QuHarrison Terry:	AndvidIQmakes it easier than ever to make that happen. You know? So get in the dashboard, use vidIQ and figure out where people are viewing your content. What I would do is I would make a super, super easy path for my highest engaged viewers to find me. In my case, let's say it's a mobile phone. I would go to Landbot and I would make a chatbot experience that is like a landing page. I don't know if you've seen Landbot.
Liron Segev:	Well let's explain it for those who don't know.
QuHarrison Terry:	Yeah. So Landbot is a website that allows you to create chatbot simultaneously or instantaneously with relative ease. You don't need to know how to code, and it looks really, really slick, and it's super fascinating and captivating. I would use Landbot to basically wow the viewer, because your content already did that. They watched your content, they're engaged. You need to meet them exactly where they're at, right?
And so if they're already amazed, keep them there. So I would use that so I wouldn't have to worry about the UX to design, and I would create an experience that was just asking them a question. It could be a survey. Answer these questions or fill out this form or play this game or do whatever." And at the end, I've gotten your information and you've gotten something out of it.
I would then reach back out and I would analyze all the feedback and all the surveys and all the results that are coming in, and I would reach out via email, Slack, Discourse, text message. Whatever platform you chose, I would reach back to those people and say, "Hey, I saw your results. This was really cool. I was fascinated, blah blah." And if you're an introvert, because if you're an introvert you probably don't want to do that, I would automate it.
I would pre-write all my little scripts, and I would just copy and paste it, copy and paste it, copy and paste it. Even if you don't want a response, make it so that they just can say yes or no.
And then you don't have to continue the conversation, right? But I would look back and just analyze how many yeses, how many no's.
Liron Segev:	Well, what's great about that is that not only do you get the cumulative results, so many yeses, so many no's, but I love the idea of identifying kind of your top engaged fan and then having a one-on-one conversation. "Thank you very much. You gave me amazing feedback. I really appreciate you being here. I'll look forward to seeing you on the next episode, and I'll be looking out for you in the next forum." Something like that.
QuHarrison Terry:	Totally. Exactly.
Liron Segev:	Yeah, you have a fan for life.
QuHarrison Terry:	You definitely have a fan for life, and they feel comfortable suggesting things they want to see, topics they want to watch or hear, and that's powerful.
Liron Segev:	That's ridiculously powerful. I think what just to be kind of really the cherry on the cake here is if you can ever reply back to someone with a video message as opposed to an email or a message, that's a game over.
QuHarrison Terry:	Game over. That's hard. That's hard to do. It is very hard to do.
Liron Segev:	If you use a tool like IFTTT ( If This Then That), you can actually design a whole bunch of pre-scripted thank you messages or pre-scripted welcome to my channel messages, and simply use that and automate your life away.
QuHarrison Terry:	Really? I didn't know that.
Liron Segev:	How awesome would that be to do that?
QuHarrison Terry:	I love the sequence. I never thought about it, because then you're making four videos but the sequence is the same every time, and it's just as personal.
Liron Segev:	And it's just someone who gets it on their phone. It's like getting a shout-out from your favorite celebrity. You feel special. And this is about building that relationship with your audience.
So as we wrap up here, anything else that comes to your mind? I mean, I love the fact that you have a helicopter view dealing with slow many companies.
QuHarrison Terry:	Yeah, a couple of points, right? You need to repeat any of these processes that we've mentioned in order for them to work, because nothing really works when it comes to conversations the first time. Imagine any good relationship you had, and go back to the first conversation with that person. The first conversation was probably not the conversation that made that a great relationship. It's awkward, it's weird. You don't know each other. First date stuff.
The first conversations, those are the ones you really want to like, you want to throw those shots away. That's not the best moment. And in that knowing that, you have to repeat these processes, you have to try these conversations. Don't be annoying. Don't be annoying, don't be creepy. Don't only respond to the attractive followers that you have.
But the more frequent you are when talking to the people that you want to engage with, the more likely they'll become loyal watchers and admire some of the things you have to say, and build relationships that last. I think if you get stuck, it's probably not easy enough.
It's probably the process that you have is probably not easy enough. So when I think about the businesses that don't talk to their customers, it's not because they don't have the desire or know why it's important, it's because the process in which they need to talk to their customers is not easy enough for them to do on a repeat process.
Liron Segev:	Okay, that's a good point. Just keep it simple.
QuHarrison Terry:	Yeah, keep it simple. And I think stay open. All the the people that we've mentioned, you'd be comfortable asking them literally anything, and even dumb questions, right? Don't be the snob that says, "Ask me the hardest question so I can answer that and show off my intellectual prowess." That's not going to build a great community, and it's going to deter a lot of the first time newcomers that actually are going to be your most valuable assets when it comes to word-of-mouth virality.
And when you have a strong community, you actually won't have to answer the easy questions because your community will do it for you because they will want the visibility.
Liron Segev:	Yeah, a hundred percent. We do live streams all the time, and our own community tends to allow other people in the community asking those questions, which they already know the answer to. It helps them, they feel good because they're contributing, they're part of the bigger picture. It's just a win-win situation. I dig that.
QuHarrison Terry:	Exactly.
Liron Segev:	Okay, this is what I love is that it seems so simple once we have the conversation, but so many people are not thinking along those lines. So now this is the challenge to everyone listening, is to go back to your content, go look at your analytics, don't be afraid. Find out where the people are watching you, and see how you can engage with them on that platform. Make it simple for them to communicate with you and don't be a snob. Don't only answer the high subscriber people, answer every single one of those. I know it's difficult, but that is how you build your own community.
QuHarrison Terry:	Totally.
Liron Segev:	Okay, we're going to have to have you on again, because I feel every time we speak there's just so much more that we can go into.
QuHarrison Terry:	All right, thanks.

Why Storytelling is the Most Important Skill a YouTuber Can Have: TubeTalk Episode 166
Did you know the way you film yourself has a very real impact on your audience, sometimes in a more negative way than you ever intended? Or that developing the skill for storytelling will turn you from a good YouTuber into a great one?
In this week’s episode of TubeTalk, the YouTuber’s podcast, we speak to a filmmaker who's going to be sharing all the industries tips and tricks on how to get better at storytelling and how to engage your audience. If that's what you're looking for for your videos, this is the episode for you!
In this podcast you will learn:

Our guest this week is Victoria Grech, a global authority on filmmaking. Her profession takes her around the world, and her extensive list of clients span Europe, United States, Asia, and Canada.
Tips and Tricks to Being a Better YouTube Storyteller
Victoria started on YouTube by teaching viewers how to use DSLR cameras and just 12 months later was teaching the same subject at Pinewood Film Studios! One of the biggest lessons she learned that as a creator, you have to provide value to the audience.
But how do you convey the passion and expertise you have for a subject to provide that value? By being a great storyteller!
Many of us can stand in front of a camera and reel off 10 things about the latest piece of tech, but can you tell a really good story about those 10 things? Are you delivering the message in the right way?
Victoria confirms that storytelling is a real skill, and it’s one of the major reasons why top creators and production companies can charge the rates they do. The majority of YouTube creators haven’t been to film school and have no real idea the process being scriptwriting or other skills so often approach filmmaking the wrong way. But by understanding how to really communicate with their audience can transform a creator’s content.
Victoria advises any video creator to study neuroscience psychology which will help you take the viewer on a journey. A good script can make the viewer laugh, cry, feel nervous, then feel happy all in 30 seconds!
Tune into this week's TubeTalk podcast to learn how to be an expert storyteller on YouTube. Huge thanks to Victoria for her insights and advice - don't forget to follow her onTwitterandFacebook, and check herwebsitefor more details about her work.

Title: How to Get More Views on YouTube Like The King of Random

How to Get More Views on YouTube Like The King of Random
Welcome to the first in an exciting new series focusing on some of the most inspiring YouTubers around today. We're taking a look at their creator journey, and the story behind their success.
In this episode, the spotlight falls on Grant Thompson, otherwise known to millions as 'The King of Random'. Grant nearly quit the platform three times before finding the right work/life balance for himself and his team. His 'The King of Random' YouTube channel now boastsover 11.3M subscribers, and 2.4B views, and he has built a solid business around his YouTube content. You can read the full transcript of Grant's story below:
YouTube Creator Journey: The King of Random
Hey, guys. My name is Grant Thompson, known around the internet as The King of Random. For the last eight years, I've been very passionate about figuring out how the world works and really taking time to figure out the mechanics of our society, everything from pyrotechnics to napkin folding, and from welding to making bread. Everything that I've learned so far, I've turned into videos and put on my YouTube channel so that all the knowledge and experience I've been gaining through my personal experiences could be shared with the rest of the world. Our YouTube channel has over 10 million subscribers now and 2 billion video views. And I'm gonna show you how it all started, because this is my creator journey.

Here's the super fast version of my life story before YouTube. I was born in Canada to some amazing parents who tried their best to raise a kid like me. And probably like a lot of kids out there, I struggled in school and grew up with low self-esteem. I also got bullied and became a trouble-maker to get attention and that ended up getting me in trouble with the law.
But, at age 14, I decided to take ownership for my life. I started finding joy in things like extreme sports, cliff jumping, whitewater rafting, repelling, and even skydiving. And by age 19, I left Canada to go to England for two years to serve a voluntary church mission. And then I came home, bought an airplane, and decided to work on the oil rigs as a roughneck, blowing up dynamite and drilling for oil in the Northwest Territories.
It was dangerous work, but the money that I made was enough to help me pay for my airplane and the fuel for all the time I spent flying it. I got licensed as long-haul tanker truck driver at age 22. Then I moved to Oahu, Hawaii to fly airplanes and drive motor coaches for Hawaiian tourists. While I was out there, I became a commercial airline pilot, and moved back to the mainland to work for SkyWest Airlines by age 23. And with that stable career, I got married at age 26, bought 11 houses, and semi-retired at age 29. My wife and I have four kids, all boys. And during that time, that's when we decided to buckle down, learn how the world works, and start making videos on YouTube.
A lot of people ask me how the King of Random got started. And it was really back in 2009 when the economy was struggling, there were rumors of another great depression. I had a wife and kids to take care of and I took that responsibility seriously. So, I started on a personal journey to intimately understand how the important things in our society work, like light bulbs, electricity, and filtered water.
I wanted to know how they were produced and I wanted to know how to make them at home if I needed to. So, I spent the next year tinkering and experimenting with anything I could get for free off the classified ads. And in the process, I was making discoveries about things that were blowing my mind. I made an arc welder out of microwave parts. I build rocket rocket motors from sugar. I played with high voltage electricity that I made from glass bottles and saltwater.
And what was really fun about that time, was as I'd share these random experiments with friends, people began asking like, who is this guy? Why does he know these kinds of things? And quite often, I'd share my newest passions with my brother and he always seemed to have this friend hanging around just listening in the background to all these random projects going on. And one day, he just stepped up and said, "Dude, you're like the King of Random." And that's pretty much where the name came from.
I could feel that the things I was experimenting with were kind of peculiar. And people in general seemed unusually interested to know more. So, that's when I decided to learn how to make videos and start sharing these ideas on YouTube.
In 2010, I created my first YouTube channel. And since I wasn't really planning on becoming a famous YouTuber, I just enter the date and time, which was 01032010814. It was just this random number, but it gave me a place where I could upload stuff. And so, I started using my handicam to make fun little videos about how to start fires using water bottles or how to build rockets and random things like that because I thought it was cool to share. And it seems like the internet agreed because hundreds of thousands of people started watching them.
Now, right about the end of 2011, that's when I started getting really serious. I thought, I could probably make this a business because nobody else was making the kind of content I was sharing and there seemed to be a need for it. YouTube had just offered monetization to creators, so I got my channel monetized and I said, I'll do this as an experiment. The idea was if I made 100 videos that were good enough to get 100,000 views, then it would probably be worth it. And in the process, I'd have a great excuse to learn more about the things I was passionate about anyway.
Some people have asked how I know so much about so many different things and the truth is, I really don't. When I began, I wasn't an expert at all. I just looked at the kind of people I'd like to be, even though most of them were fictional, like MacGyver or James Bond. But the Mythbusters were a great real-life inspiration to me. I wondered how do you go from knowing absolutely nothing, to being just like one of those guys. So, this became my own personal journey, one step at a time, learning how different things work to become like MacGyver or more like a Mythbuster myself.
Sometimes, I'm interested in welding and do a bunch of welding projects. Sometimes, it's pyrotechnics. Sometimes, I'll just be folding napkins 'cause I was on a cruise and I thought that was cool. Or I could be making apple swans. It's just whatever I'm interested in. I typically spend a little bit of time in a few videos exploring those topics, and then once I was satisfied, move onto something else.
Like most internet content creators, almost all day, every day, I spent working on new videos, concepts, and ideas to the point where it was almost an obsession. And I think this happens for a lot of creators. It go to the point where I felt like I was actually limiting my own personal progression so that I could keep making videos and content for the internet. It was a real battle because what I really wanna do is just play and explore the world, but then nobody knows about it. But if I take the time to create videos, then I don't have as much time to play and tinker. So, it's been this constant struggle to juggle the best of both worlds. But it's really been worth 'cause it stretched me and made me grow.
The success of our YouTube channel has helped build me as a person, it's helped build my self-confidence. You know, back before I'd made any projects myself, I did feel a little insecure in this society, because I didn't know how anything worked. And when you don't know something, you're kind of dependent on the system. But now things are completely different.
I've learned so much and feel like I've broken through to the point where I could be okay supporting my family whether or not there's any kind of apocalyptic collapse. And not only that, but in the process, people have looked to me as an inspiration and people are actually willing to try a few things for themselves because I've left a trail for them to follow.
These videos aren't just about showing cool things that we've made. It's really about empowering people, showing you that you can try something new and do something you thought was difficult. So many people have stopped me in the streets and told me how they've sat down as a family and done some of the projects together from our channel. And that's something I could have never predicted when I started making these videos eight years ago.
I think one of the hardest things for creators these days is experiencing massive success. When you make something that does really well and attracts an audience, that audience expects you to make more, which is really awesome. But it kinda ties you into this cycle where you have to constantly be making more. And if you're the one doing it, then it has to be you. It's your face, your mind, your projects. And it really is stressful and it's a constant grind. I think that's why we see so many creators today suffering from mental health issues and needing to take breaks.
I was at that point myself two years ago, ready to quit YouTube for the third time when I read a book called The E Myth, and that changed my life. I started building systems instead of building videos. I hired my first employee, started putting together training programs, started to become more of a leader, and started treating the YouTube production more like a business as well, one that was gonna stick around longer than I would.
And now here we are today with 14 employees making five videos a week. We're finally at a place now, where we've built a really good machine that I think looks really promising. We've got the platform, we've got the content that we produce every day, and now I'm bringing in the employees that can spend all day tinkering and prototyping and playing in a sustainable way that's not gonna burn them out. So, looking forward, The King of Random movement has a very bright future.
We're starting to roll out project kits that people can do at home. We're thinking about putting together a King of Random camp, where people can get together and build things. We're writing books, we're selling merchandise. We'd might even find a way to put project kits in schools so that teacher and kids could do these things in class. The only real guarantee in life is change. So, whatever the future holds for me and The King of Random, one thing's for sure. I'm sure we're all gonna learn a lot. And the journey, no doubt, will be random. Stay random my friends and we'll see you in the next video.
We'd like to say a HUGE thanks to Grant for taking us on his journey. Tune in next week for a brand new episode.

Title: The Journey to 470,000 YouTube Subscribers: TubeTalk Episode 162

The Journey to 470,000 YouTube Subscribers: TubeTalk Episode 162
Every creator on YouTube has a story to tell about their journey. It’s fascinating to dive into a fellow YouTube creators journey, to see how they got to where they are now, the special moments along the way, and what really triggered the growth of their channel.
In this week’s episode of TubeTalk, the YouTuber podcast, we’re joined by one such creator who has a compelling story to tell on his journey to470,000 YouTube subscribers.
Joe Scott started his career as a screenwriter on multiple indie films, alongside his main job as a copywriter for The Dallas Morning News for 12 years. During that time he turned his attention to YouTube, creating ‘Answers With Joe’, which was picked to be a part of YouTube’s NextUp program, which honors promising channels and creators on the rise. Answers With Joe hit the important 100,000 subscriber milestone in February 2018 and currently has over 470,000 subscribers.

The Journey to 470,000 YouTube Subscribers
Your channel's about kind of answering questions. How did you kind of choose that genre or did it kind of all choose you maybe? Initially, he was broadcasting mainly to family and friends, answering their queries on a range of topics. His content at the beginning was 100% comedy based, inspired by video OG ZeFrank. He then noticed that real answers to questions generated more engagement, so he pivoted slightly to focus on answering one question per video rather than seven or eight. He essentially started doubling down on the content that he found was working for him.
Often, creators start on YouTube but get frustrated very quickly because of the lack of traction, which Joe totally understand because he experienced the same thing. But going all in, and committed to the creator process will pay off if you dedicate yourself to improving with every upload. YouTube is also the long-game for the vast majority of creators, and Joe confirms that you have to give your “permission” to do it so you become more invested. It's when he did that then things really took a turn for the better for his content and his channel.
Tune into the podcast to hear more tips on the YouTube creator journey from Joe Scott. Huge thanks to Joe for his time and invaluable insights around YouTube video strategy. Learn more from Joe by following him onTwitter,Facebook,Snapchat, andInstagram.

Title: How to Get to 250,000 Subscribers on YouTube: Steve Dotto Creator Journey

How to Get to 250,000 Subscribers on YouTube: Steve Dotto Creator Journey
Welcome to the second in our exciting new series focusing on some of the most inspiring YouTubers on the platform right now. We're taking a look at their specific creator journey, and the inspiring story behind their success on YouTube.
This episode focuses on Steve Dotto, AKADottotech. Steve's tech-orientated YouTube Channel boasts nearly 244,000 subscribers, and 19.9 million views, and he's built a solid business around his YouTube content, after years of mainstream broadcasting. You can read the full transcript of Steve's story below:
Steve Dotto's YouTube Creator Journey
Hi, I'm Steve Dotto, a YouTube creator. Now I wasn't always a YouTube creator. I used to be the host of a TV show and an executive producer. But that was then, and I'm much happier now. Let me tell you my creator journey.

For nearly 20 years I hosted and produced a TV show in Canada on how to use technology. I was what you might call a B-List celebrity. People would recognize me in restaurants or at the airport, and they would ask me all the time, "Should I get a Mac or a PC," and I would tell them, get a MAC, eh. And then they'd go and buy a PC. Good times.
In 2011, the networks and I parted our ways and I began to look at what YouTube has to offer. I was blown away. For the first time in my career the most important people were my audience, not tacky network executives, ad agencies, marketing managers and PR hacks. No, no, no - real people like you! I like you.
See, when you're creating TV shows, there are a whole bunch of people who stand between you and the audience. They're the people with money, the people with power. Money to pay for your production and the power to put you on air or remove you. YouTube takes all their power away.
From the first videos I created on YouTube I saw something different about YouTube. I saw that this was a platform that allowed me to build relationships with my audience, and here is the most important lesson that I learned in my creator journey: If you talk to your community, really talk with them, listen to them, and respect them, they will become your greatest asset. Answer every comment. Reply to every question and your creator story will be a success.
Oh it's not all roses and chicken wings, however, there's a certain loneliness to being a YouTube creator. All the people I used to be on a team with have been replaced by USB ports on my computer. Now, USB is a fine communication technology, but it's a lousy lunch date. Thank goodness I have my dog Farley hanging with me. All YouTube creators need a Farley in the house to keep them company.
Then of course, there's that unpleasant need to pay the mortgage. Oh, I've turned YouTube into a healthy business now, but you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find the golden egg. I might've mixed my metaphors there, but you get the point. It's still really all about the people.
I can look at the milestones, the silver play button at 100,000 subscribers, hitting the million then 10 million minute viewed mark, but nothing speaks to me like going into YouTube comments and seeing the names. Real people, commenting, challenging me, thanking me, asking me questions, and becoming a community. My community.
Huge thanks to Steve Dotto for his time and insights. You can follow Steve onYouTube,Twitter,Facebookor via hiswebsite.

How to Master the YouTube Algorithm: TubeTalk Episode 159
YouTube is all about content and if you can show lots of value on your channel, YouTube is going to suggest your videos to help you generate more views and subscribers. On this episode of TubeTalk, the YouTuber podcast, we’re going to show you how to hack the YouTube algorithm - in the legal and correct way, of course.
We’re joined by Tom Martin, a YouTube strategist extraordinaire. Tom is Certified by YouTube as an expert in both Audience Growth and Digital Rights. He has led the YouTube strategy for some of the world’s largest and most successful media companies, like the BBC, gaining them millions of subscribers and billions of views. He has also consulted with YouTube Creators and Fortune 500 companies to improve their results on YouTube via his companyChannel Fuel.
He specializes in both YouTube SEO, optimization and channel strategy and has dedicated his time to making sure other YouTube Creators can learn from his experience. He is the author of 'YouTube Optimization – The Complete Guide.'

The Three C’s of YouTube Success
Tom confirms that there are a number of factors that could be affecting a channel's growth or lack of growth - he calls them the three Cs of YouTube:
While being consistent with upload schedules and content topics is YouTube 101, being consistent with metadata, or how you optimize your content is key. Titles, tags, and descriptions need to work for you on a channel level, as well as on an individual video level. Having a system for works to create an ecosystem of all of your videos and it’s something Tom has been working on for years. Because of his extraordinary access to a billion views' worth of data, he’s been able to refine this system down as close to scientific process as possible. Tom states that it’s the job of any channel manager, whether you're doing it for yourself or for somebody else, to engineer relationships between your own videos so that you dominate that sidebar. That’s the path to crazy, crazy suggested views.
People totally forget that YouTube is, at the end of the day, a search engine. Good old SEO practices that work in the blogging world and on Google Search are going to have to be applied on YouTube too. It’s not about the relationship between you and your video content, it’s the relationship between your videos as a whole, and it’s a system that Tom unpacks on the podcast.
Keyword Research: The Basis of YouTube Success
Tom’s system is based on a process called keyword research. It’s a tool that is widely underused, probably the most underused weapon that any channel manager or YouTube creator could use. Most people are NOT using it, or certainly not using it to its full power.
Keyword research is often misunderstood because it's easy to do a quick search and say, "Okay, I'm going to put this in the tags of this single video and hope for the best." That's how it used to work in 2012 but that's not the same anymore, because YouTube and Google are a lot smarter now, and they understand content a lot better. Also, there's a lot more competition, and so there's a lot more other videos with similar metadata to cut through. Tom engineer’s relationships between his videos using keyword research, to go a level beyond just trying to rank an individual video. His aim to be the authority in his space, and he has usedvidIQ’s Keyword Toolfor the last seven years to identify exact search volume, an incredibly important metric for YouTube creators.
Tom looks for keywords that are getting high search volume (meaning lots of people searching for it that month), but low competition. That combination means that either there's not enough videos being made around that subject to cover that search demand, or the videos are being made, but the competition are not optimizing their videos for the right keywords. vidIQ’s Keyword Tool helps Tom find opportunities in the market around his main channel keywords (or ‘seed’ keywords).
Tune into the podcast to find out exactly how using keyword research will help you truly master the YouTube algorithm today.

How To Get More Views On YouTube as a Small Channel: TubeTalk Episode 160
Big YouTube creators can afford to employ a team to help film, record sound, and edit but what about the smaller creators who have to fulfill all of those roles? In this episode of TubeTalk, the YouTuber podcast, we speak to two creators who have worked out what they need to focus on in order to save time and really produce some amazing content and grow their channel. If you want to know what those tips and tricks are so that you can do it on your channel, this is the show for you.
We’re joined on this podcast by Jeff Mendez fromEl Jefe Reviews, and Travis McPherson. Jeff is a West Coast California native who's love of music and tech has led him to create an audio-centric channel. He’s been active on YouTube for 2 years, and his channel has 15K subscribers.
Travis McPhersonis a gadget fan who has a love of technology and an interest in entertainment which spurred him to create a YouTube channel. He has 32K subscribers.

3 Tips on How To Get More Views On YouTube as a Small Channel
For any smaller channel working towards building significant views and subscribers on YouTube, listening to this week's TubeTalk podcast is a must! Our guests give us some incredible insights regarding YouTube, and here's just a taste of some of the tips and strategy Jeff and Travis use on their own YouTube channels:
#1 It's Never, Never Too Late to Build a Great YouTube Channel
There is a perception that YouTube is already over-saturated but that isn’t the case - even in 2019. But the key factor is that every creator has their own voice, their own personality and their own story, and spin on things. So, there is no other Travis, there is no other Jeff, or any other creator so it's definitely not too late.
Travis confirms that even a year ago he was convinced that it was impossible to grow a channel on YouTube, but learning what he learned, knowing what he knows now, it's not too late. Literally, there are channels that come out of nowhere and kind of blow up and it's totally possible. It's not easy, but it's totally possible.
#2 Every YouTuber Needs to Put in the Work
A lot of aspiring creators look to YouTube and the opportunity it brings to many millions like free products and free trips and they think, "Hey, Hey I wanna be part of that." Many people have an unrealistic expectation of what YouTube is and how much work you've got to put into that. Even seasoned creators like Jeff underestimated the amount of work being a YouTube creator was.
He assumed it was just as simple as recording your video, and then uploading to YouTube - never mind creating custom thumbnails, or thinking of the best title, or search engine optimization. But all these things go into creating a YouTube video strategy if you're serious about growing.
YouTube is essentially a business, and with every business there are expenses, and marketing, and accounting and all that good stuff. If you treat YouTube as a business it’s a better way to look at it versus, "Hey, I slapped a bunch of videos together and look, people are gonna send me overseas!”.
#3 Find your Niche on YouTune Then Double Down
YouTube hates variety, because it doesn't know how to help you. It loves it when you do one thing, because it can then find an audience for you. When you do two, three, or four things, now it wants to help you, it just simply cannot.
The problem with YouTube is the rules of the game. You try to take any kind of step out of the niche that you've made for yourself, and you may not get any traction at all. So when deciding on your niche, make sure it's something you can do for a very long time. For instance, if you have a cooking channel and are getting some great views and engagement for your content, then three months down the road you want to blog about how you're going to have a baby, you may kill your views dead.
Of course, you need to be adaptable - and the ever changing YouTube algorithm and platform changes will force you to do that. But identifying your niche and sticking with it is what’s going to help you grow. You're going to really struggle if the videos you’re creating aren’t your passion in the long run.
Tune into the podcast to hear more tips on building a solid video strategy around your YouTube channel. Huge thanks to Jeff and Travis for their advice and insights.

Title: How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Research is Everything!

How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Research is Everything!
In the latest in our series on 'How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube,' we discuss just how important research is. How important? It's probably the MOST important prep you can do before you pick up that video camera, and it isn't an exaggeration to state that the success of your whole YouTube Channel depends on it. So, yes, it's pretty important.
How to Get More YouTube Views with Your Gaming Channel
There are millions of gaming channels on YouTube right now, so how do you stand out from the crowd? We've already talked aboutmaking you the star of your YouTube channeland taking your personality to the forefront. But when it comes to the games, you need to be able to answer questions that nobody else can answer, faster than anyone else, or better than anyone else?
Let's use Clash Royale as the example. Every couple of weeks they release new cards for you to play with, one being a new card called the Giant Snowball. Now you don't really need to know anything about that other than if you search on YouTube for 'Clash Royale Giant Snowball tips', you'll find there'll be big YouTubers at the top of the search rankings. But if you just go down a little bit, you'll find a channel with only a thousand subscribers but a video that has 150,000 views. So, how did this happen?

That video answers a very specific question about one particular game, and it was one of the first videos out on the topic. This is the first video this channel has made, and it has 150,000 views and have gained 1,600 subscribers from that. So this, if nothing else, is proof that you can start a gaming channel in 2019 if you do the right things.
Because I have a passionate knowledge about that video game, I know what to search for. It should be the same for you, whatever game you're interested in. But let's take an example of a game I know nothing about: Fortnite.
I did a couple of searches, and within five minutes I was able to search for 'best shotgun in Fortnite save the world 2018' as a long tail keyword. And instead of finding channels with millions of subscribers, I found channels with a few thousand subscribers getting tens of thousands of views.
So it is possible to do on any type of game. You just have to think of this from a really specific point of view. Are there any Easter eggs that you know of that nobody else does? Is there a big patch coming out with new weapons that you want to cover before anybody else? Think about how you can offer something valuable, new, and unique to your audience before anybody else or, as I said earlier, better than anyone else. And you're onto a winning strategy when it comes to a gaming channel.

Title: How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Double Down on Successful Content

How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Double Down on Successful Content
When it comes to starting a Gaming channel on YouTube, stick to your guns. There's two ways to look at this. First of all, stick to one game for a period of time so you build a rapport with your audience for a particular game, and a particular topic around a game.
I've seen so many channels play Need For Speed one day, FIFA 18 the next, then WWE 2K18 the next day. Your audience is just not going to know where you are on what you've decided on. It's too exhausting for them to keep up.
The second way to look at sticking to your guns is when you have successful content, double down on that strategy. If you find a particular secret, which is really interesting to your audience, find another way to look at that secret or something that's very similar.

You'll be able to use the VidIQChannel Audit toolto see which is your best content over the last 30 days. Check on it on a regular basis and see if you can double down on more of that content.

Title: How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Custom Thumbnails Can Make or Break You

How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Custom Thumbnails Can Make or Break You
In the latest in our series on how to start a gaming channel on YouTube, we’re going to take a look atcustom thumbnails. If you look at any of the top gaming channels on YouTube, you will see that their thumbnails are a work of art, really bright, oversaturated, with lots of punch that really draws you into the visuals when you're deciding what to watch next. Two quick golden rules for gaming thumbnails are:
A very common mistake gaming channels make is to take a screenshot from the game and use it as their thumbnail without any further editing or context. And what some channels do is use the same screenshot over and over again with multiple videos. And that just really isn't appealing at all to the casual viewer.
I understand, as a video creator myself, that there is a huge temptation to just push a video out of the door once it's finished. But you should be spending at least 30 to 60 minutes on your thumbnail, making sure that it's not too cluttered, and that the one or two objects in that thumbnail really tell a compelling story.

Look at the top YouTubers in your video game sphere and see how they craft their thumbnails. We're even seeing smaller channels on YouTube producing amazing thumbnails. It's a really competitive area, and video creators are understanding more and more that custom thumbnails are vitally important whatever channel size you are. So, make sure you work really hard on them.

Title: How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Find the Best Opportunities

How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: Find the Best Opportunities
Welcome to the latest in vidIQ’s recent series on how to start a Gaming channel on YouTube. And this post’s tip is - no game lasts forever, and at some point you will have to pivot. This advice ties itself all the way back to another tip, which isyou must become the star of your own YouTube channel. Once you've built an audience, gained their trust, they become subscribers, super fans, then you should be able to take them on a journey with whatever game you like.
When pivoting, you might want to start with games that your core audience is familiar with or comfortable with. So, for example, a lot of Clash of Clan YouTubers went onto Clash Royale. For Fortnite gamers, you might want to move onto Call of Duty, or some similarly themed topic.
When you've built a huge audience, you can go wherever you want. That might be nostalgic retro games that you're a big fan of, or your favorite games of all time. For example, mine is Golden Eye on the N64. But I don't think VidIQ is quite ready for a ‘Let's Play’ on that yet.

To summarize, find an audience, become their best buddies, and then take them on a gaming journey wherever you want it to go.
It seems like these days everybody wants to have a Gaming channel on YouTube, so the competition is more fierce than ever before. And it's relentless. In fact, you could say it's like putting your video game on the hardest difficulty setting. Are you dedicated enough to beat it? That's up to you.

Title: How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: The Creator is the Star

How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube: The Creator is the Star
In the first part of our 'How to Start a Gaming Channel on YouTube' series, we're going to focus on the challenge that face gamers in 2019 with so much competition about. Now, if you're not a gamer, don't worry. Stick around because many of the strategies that we suggest to you are relevant for all types of channels. We're just putting it into the video game context.
Let's start with tip number one. The most important thing about your channel is not the video game you're going to cover, it's YOU. While the average viewer may find your content through a YouTube search or suggested videos, they stick around because of what you can uniquely offer to your audience. Whather that's through the humor that you have, the energy, the enthusiasm, or the passion. It's all about how YOU and your content makes your audience feel beyond any video game that you're actually playing.
Ask yourself two questions. Question #1: why do you go back to your favorite video game YouTubers? Is it because of the video games they're playing or because of the personality of the channel and that they connect with you directly.

The second question is, if they pivoted from the video game that you're interested in, would you still go to their channel, irrespective of what video game they were playing next?
For some of you this may be your first challenge. Get in front of camera. Talk directly to your audience while you're playing your video games. If you're not ready to do that then get behind the microphone so that people can hear you. You can maybe do a face reveal later on. The key element is making YOU the star of a channel, not the games that you play.
With that being said, the video game or video games that you cover on your channel are immensely important to you. The golden rule of any YouTube channel is that if you're passionate about the topic that you're covering, you'll be passionate about how you share it with your audience. And that always comes through in the videos that you produce.

Here's a challenge for you. What is your favorite video game right now? And if you were to start a YouTube channel on it, could you come up with 10 quick video ideas in 5 minutes?
Now this may sound like a tough challenge, so I'm going to challenge myself right now. My favorite video game is Clash Royale. Here are 10 quick video ideas I can come up with off the top of my head:
I bet most of you had no idea what I was talking about, except for two or three people watching this video who have played Clash Royale. And that's the audience you need to appeal to with your gaming content. You want to really focus down and concentrate on a target audience with a specific value proposition that they can relate to.

Who should be watching? Why should they care? We've brought this up many times before. It applies to your video game channels as well.

How to Build a YouTube Community Around Trends: Full Transcript
Liron Segev:	Dan, welcome to the show.
Dan Currier:	Thank you for having me.
Liron Segev:	Who is Dan in a tweet? How would you describe you?
Dan Currier:	In a tweet, I certainly have a lot of passions and a lot of different projects I'm working on on YouTube. I have a YouTube channel called Creator Fundamentals that is all about simplifying YouTube to help other creators grow on the platform.
Liron Segev:	Fantastic. How important it is to understand this thing called trends on YouTube? We keep hearing about a viral video, and hashtag challenges. What are those keywords which have been flying around for us as creators who have our channels, what should we be looking for? Should we be riding those trends? How do we detect them early? Where do we even begin?
Dan Currier:	I think one of the biggest things to understand when it comes to trends is not every successful attempt to jump on a trend has a net positive gain for your YouTube channel. What we see is a lot of our creators who try to jump on a trend, something popular that's going on, and oftentimes they'll hit on something but it's not really aligned with the niche that they're focusing on for their channel.
While it may sound and feel like a good thing in the beginning, you're getting a lot of new subscribers and views and your live statistics are off the charts and it's a really good feeling, long term it can have some really detrimental effects on your channel. It's definitely important when we think about trends that we are looking at trending topics in line with the topics that we're covering on our channels.
Liron Segev:	Okay. There's a couple of things to dive into there. Just because something is trending and something is doing well as a general rule might not necessarily mean that we should be jumping on that trend. Is that right?
Dan Currier:	Right. Ultimately, what happens is when a situation like that occurs, say for example you have a YouTube channel with 5,000 subscribers and you hit on a viral video that's not related to your typical content and you bring in 2,000 new subscribers in a week. Well, now you find yourself in a situation where you have those original 5,000 subscribers that are looking for one type of content, a new 2,000 who are looking for a different kind of content and it puts you in that odd position of are you going to be true to the original audience or are you going to continue to make videos related to the viral content in an effort to appease the new audience.
It puts you at odds, it splits your audience, and a lot of times it just causes problems with your entire strategy. The long term effect of that can really knock creators off their game in terms of the type of content they should be making.
Liron Segev:	Is this true across the board? In other words, regardless of your channel size or your niche, if you tack onto something that isn't within your core audience or your core values, could those hurt your channel even when you're a bigger channel?
Dan Currier:	Yes. Obviously, if the trend that you jump on, you know, as related to your entire audience. If you have 100,000 subscribers and something hits and you get a couple thousand from it, obviously it's not going to dilute your audience to that degree. It would probably be a little less of an impact on your overall growth. At the same time, you're still bringing in that audience that ultimately is probably not going to be served any value from your future content because they came in on a topic you don't typically cover.
Liron Segev:	Okay. That makes sense. There's a core audience. Yes, there may be a bit of dilution on the fringes, but if you get back to doing what you're doing, you'll probably will retain that momentum and that audience will forgive you a little bit because you've built up some sort of a trust, some sort of authority. If you make this a habit, I think that you're going to feel it very much in your analytics.
Dan Currier:	Yeah, and a lot of times especially on small or midsize channels, when you do, if you haven't experienced a trending or a viral type video and that takes off, you're almost compelled to want to follow it up with similar content. It could be two or three videos. If you're doing it right, you're following that up with related content to ride that trend and get the most out of it. If you're riding that trend away from the kind of content you actually want to make, it can hurt you.
Liron Segev:	Well, the one thing you seem to have done really well is understand this and apply it to your own channel. You've got this great video called, ‘How to Get 1,000 Subscribers and 4,000 Watch Hours’ with about 400 odd thousand views on that particular video. This was done about a year ago, I would say, which is a really good time. Within a year, over 400,000 views. Amazing stuff. Tell me about that video. How did you come up with this? What was your research like? Was this a trending thing that you were going after or was it a specific question? How did this happen?
Dan Currier:	All right, there's a couple of different things here. Part of it actually ties into the other topic that you talked about, which is community. I'll explain that in a minute. Basically, what happened prior, obviously, I do content for YouTube creators. It's all about educating them and keeping them up to date on news.
One of the things that was going on was a delay in a number of creators who had reached 10,000 views, which used to be the requirement for the YouTube partner program, but had not been monetized. YouTube was putting out very vague information and basically stringing these people along because it had been months since they reached it but they weren't approving anybody. This started to get me thinking that a change was in the works because of the lack of information and the time that had passed.
I think one of the important takeaways in terms of trending is to understand your niche, be aware of current events that are happening, and recognize when certain changes or news articles are going to receive an emotional response from the audience. Where we were at this point, I could feel the frustration building. A lot of people kept reaching out to me asking me why they hadn't been monetized. Then YouTube came out with the news that they changed it from 10,000 views to 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours.
Now, the way that this actually ties into the community aspect is I have a number of different things I do to get news alerts and stuff. I have certain things that I've set up on Twitter to try to tag certain people to get information as quickly as possible to be able to jump on these things.
In that particular case, it was actually a member of my community. Somebody who was subscribed to my channel who reached out to me and let me know that that news article had dropped. Along those lines, one of the things that I had committed to do prior to this whole thing, which is a good tip for anybody is set up your studio. Set up your space in such a way where you can make content without a lot of preparation.
Meaning, if you can get a dedicated space to set up to be able to pop in and do a video quick, if you have content that obviously is related to that. The value, the way that I was able to capitalize on this trend is essentially being the first person to market, so to speak, where I knew there was going to be an emotional response. I knew this was a very important news topic.
As soon as I heard the news, I literally turned on my camera and made a video. Now the one that has 400,000 views was actually the second video because I decided right away that I was going to make two videos. The first of which was meet everybody where they were and it was a frustration video. It started off in YouTube's effort to screw small YouTubers because I knew that's how people were going to feel. In that first video I kind of met them right at the front door with that emotion.
That's another important concept or key with trending content is when a topic evokes emotion, you know there's going to be a large audience involved in that. I decided to meet them where I knew they were on an emotional level. Then that first video, I walked them through that emotion and ended that video with the idea of, you're going to have to come up with a way to move forward if this is important to you.
The next day I released the ‘How to Get 1000 Subscribers and 4000 Watch Hours’ to tap into those people who were frustrated but wanted to continue. That second video came out with the pity party's over, time for us to get to work. Then I outlined the ways that they could do that. I also, just from a content perspective, that particular video also referred to several other videos on my channel where they could get different information on aspects of moving forward. All in all it worked out pretty well.
Liron Segev:	It was reading the audience, reading the sentiment before an announcement was made. By the time the announcement was made, you already prepped, you ran your research, you knew what's going to be the pain points, and then you knew how to fix those pain points and this is exactly what people would be searching for. These are some great points. You said you used social media?
Dan Currier:	Yeah, variety of other things. There are lists on Twitter where you can tag a bunch of things so you can pop in there and see kind of a news feed from those particular tags. Like you said, I get Google alerts and I try to touch base in other news resources to try to stay on top of that stuff.
Liron Segev:	If somebody has a chef channel, a cooking channel, or someone's a vlogger or someone does, I don't know, check how tos, do we all fit into that same boat? Should we also be keeping an ear or an eye out on what's happening? Will that help us?
Dan Currier:	I think it's going to vary a little bit obviously based on the niche and the type of content that you're making. I would say any niche or topic that you're focused on that has the potential to have breaking news or news that people would want to hear about right away has the potential to be trending in that particular category.
I know a channel that does auto related content and there was a new car that was coming out. They jumped on the news of that particular vehicle and put together a string of videos based on that vehicle that just exploded their channel and got them a ton of activity. It was also in line with the topic. In that case, it was a trending topic that brought in an audience completely related to their channel and they saw a big boom from it.
Liron Segev:	Wow. Love it, love it, love it. Again, going back to understanding that you're in a niche but your niche doesn't start and stop in YouTube. It's bleeds into absolutely everything else. If you can understand that, you can probably predict those trends because you're in it and you're feeling the frustration or you're feeling the joy or you're feeling the anticipation of something being released and just use that to your channel's advantage. That makes complete sense.
Dan Currier:	I mean, and at this point I think YouTube is pretty much a not so microcosm of life in general because of its size and its mass and the amount of content that is uploaded every hour. Anything that happens in the outside world is going to find its way to YouTube because a highly significant portion of the outside world tunes into YouTube.
Liron Segev:	Clearly, absolutely. I think my point, and your point is as well, is that once we look beyond just the borders of YouTube and beyond this whole, why am I not on the trending page? Well, trending pages are there because they are already trending. If you can understand something before it happens, well, that's where the gold is. That's where you win in a big way.
Dan Currier:	To a large degree, the trending page itself is like the Rolls-Royce of success. Well, it's okay if you go out and find yourself a couple of BMWs, it's still going to do well for the growth of your channel. You don't necessarily ever have to find the trending page to be highly successful in terms of getting content to trend within your own niche.
Liron Segev:	Okay, brilliant tips, great advice. Keeping your ear to the ground is always, always helpful. Now, the one thing we did touch upon very, very quickly is this whole community. I know from my personal experience before I let you run with this is things change dramatically when I started understanding that it's not me versus every other person in my niche, but rather than me can be included as part of coworkers, so to speak, of people in my niche. Then that mindset change alone absolutely changed my channel, changed in my attitude, changed basically everything. What do you feel about the community as a whole?
Dan Currier:	I mean, to me, it all starts in the community. In fact, for me, this particular channel Creator Fundamentals actually literally started in the community. I was actually working on my other channel called The Average Dan that was kind of a how to channel where I would make videos to help people solve problems that I ran into and I couldn't find content on.
When I "got serious," and wanted to learn how everything worked, the first thing I did was join YouTube communities on Facebook. I got involved in groups, started interacting with other people who were trying to achieve the same type of goals that I was. Through that experience, I started to learn not only the value of going in and giving value and talking to people, but that there were a lot of people in the community that needed a source of information on what actually works and what doesn't.
I mean, everybody says it, community, community, community but it is, it is an absolute game changer when you realize how powerful it can be. For me, it started in Facebook groups. From that point on it extended to making the jump and actually attending conferences in person, which just takes the community aspect to a whole different level.
Liron Segev:	Do you find that social media and the comfort of home and the computer is actually not a bad place to start?
Dan Currier:	I think it's a great place to start because I think like you said, when you do start to meet people in person, you realize that the creator space is filled with people who are introverts and have social anxiety and all those things. It's surprising to some degree because YouTube provides, YouTube and social media in general provide an outlet for these people, myself included, where you can express yourself. You can get good at your craft. You can deliver information in a comfortable setting.
Again, going into the communities, the groups and stuff like that, you can interact with other people on your own pace without the awkwardness of meeting strangers in a loud room and that kind of thing. For sure, I mean, I think it's probably more. I would probably say there's more people who are introverted than not in my experience in the people that I've come across.
Liron Segev:	I've done my thing, I'm on Facebook, I've joined some groups, I've met some people virtually. What's the next step? Should it be a meetup, local meet up? Should it be a big conference? What would you advise?
Dan Currier:	For me personally, it was a big conference only because in the area that I live in, in Upstate New York, I don't have a ton of opportunities to have creator meetups. If you live in a city or an area that seems to have a YouTuber every three people like Utah, then definitely take advantage of meetups. Dip your toe in that experience and meet people in person and start to develop relationships above and beyond just helping to learn the craft.
The relationships that you make through the YouTube community can open so many doors for you. It's not just a matter of learning how YouTube works or those kind of things. There's really a lot of opportunities present themselves through the relationships that you form.
Definitely try to hit up meetups locally if you can. If you have never gone to a conference, I definitely recommend trying to take that leap in and actually attend one because it puts you in a whole different world. As creators online, not many of us can turn off the computer and go in the other room and chat about YouTube with our spouses or our significant others, our kids, our friends because they don't understand. Then you go to an event and everybody around you is talking about the same thing and it really flips a switch of what's possible when we start to do this thing online.
Liron Segev:	I agree 100%. I mean, my first time I attended VidCon, which is the YouTubers' Disneyland as I can describe it. The first time I attended it, I looked around me and then I realized, hold on. I actually put up this tweet from VidCon, which was retweeted by VidCon which was quite funny. It was more colored hair and Gorilla tripods per square mile than anywhere in the world right now because everywhere you looked around it was just people with green, yellow, purple hair, which I have the green so I'm cool with that. They're talking to their cameras. Everyone's just relaxed because you're not weird just talking to yourself in the middle of the shopping mall vlogging. Everybody else is doing exactly the same. How cool is that? Have you been to VidCon?
Dan Currier:	I have not been to VidCon. I have been to VidSummit and also Social Media Marketing World. Those are two very different conferences from each other.
Liron Segev:	Next up on your radar has to be a VidCon just so you can complete the traffic.
Dan Currier:	I know, right? It's funny though because I truly believe in the community aspect and one of the challenges for me living in Upstate New York is that all of the conferences are actually out on the West coast or a lot of the major ones. I'm actually trying to take the concept of community to the next step here in the Northeast and trying to create a creator event here that people can come to and experience that community without having to trek across the country.
Liron Segev:	Let me ask you this. What has got you really excited right now about YouTube?
Dan Currier:	For me, YouTube has really been the springboard of what's possible and what I can do in the creative space. When I first went out to that VidSummit, it was just one of the things that people get into. Especially when people are starting YouTube channels though, you'll ask them the question, do you want it to be a business? Would you like to make this your full-time career?
A lot of people because they don't have the confidence or even realize what's possible, it's just a hobby, you know? Then they make that, they get that first AdSense and they go, oh well, maybe something could happen here. Then when you really start to get the ball rolling, you're like, hey, I can turn this into a career. For me, like I said, it's a springboard. It's just the tip of the iceberg for me and what I want to do. Obviously, I want to be able to present the content on YouTube to all of the people that are coming into the platform and learning exactly how everything works.
I think it's a great opportunity and a privilege to be there at the front door to give them the tools to do that. Above and beyond that, I want to be able to help those who want to take it to the next level to advance their education through coursework and all that other stuff. Like I said, probably that when you said excitement, the thing that pops into the head is the conference that I'm planning because it's so far out of my comfort zone, and it's mildly terrifying but at the same time it's super exciting because I know what it's going to take and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to put it all together.
I'll probably be stressed out until it actually comes about. That to me, that's super exciting, to try to see that through and create the opportunity for people to get together here on the East coast without trekking across the country and be able to do that at a much lower cost than what it does take myself and others to make it out to California.
Liron Segev:	Yeah. It must be amazing value for someone who's local, who is maybe on the fence a little bit. They kind of want to do this, but they can't afford to justify that cost at the moment. A local event is absolutely what's needed to get you over that hurdle and to actually see just how big the space is and how welcoming the space can be if you just network with the right people. If you help each other, it's amazing how many doors open, oh, I know this guy who knows this person. Those little cups of coffees in the hallway, those are worth their weight in gold. The fact you're doing one local for your area, that's amazing. I mean that's absolutely incredible. Have you got a date of when you're thinking of doing this?
Dan Currier:	Yeah, it's going to be called the people of video to focus on that entire community aspect, and it's going to be May 2nd and 3rd of 2020. I have a year to plan. I wanted to get it out there. Especially, because of the cost for people that don't have the opportunity, I wanted to make them aware of it as far in advance. If that's something that they're interested in, they can take the next year and plan for it. I have a group of people that every few months I go to New York City and I meet with a group of creators. We do this thing called the New York City video mastermind. It's just all of us getting together and it's a nice mix of people. It's myself and Ross Brand and Dan Norton, Jason Liebman, and John DiStefano from UDoIt.
A great way for all of us to get together and talk shop and let each other know what's working and what's not working from a business sense. I'm hopefully going to get all those guys up to Upstate New York as well as bring people in from the surrounding states to be able to meet people in person because I really do think that that was in person opportunities. Just open your mind to what is possible because when I went to that first VidSummit years ago, it was you get inside a bubble, you think you have a general idea of what you're doing and you start to get to a point where you think you're pretty good. Then you go to something like that and people are asking you what's your open rate is on your email list. Like, what? Email list, what's an email list?
Thinking about those things and how I learned about those concepts in those conferences and how I've taken those and learned them and implemented them since that time. It just opens your mind to just how much you can accomplish and really lets you see that light at the end of the tunnel that is making something that can actually support your channel and yourself in the future.
Liron Segev:	For people who don't know the names that you mentioned, that Dan mentioned now, the channels are so fundamentally different to each other where one is a DIY working on woodworking house kind of channel. Dan Norton's all about video creation. It's so different but yet there's a common ground and common ground is YouTube. It's amazing how you could just strike up a conversation with people regardless of what they're into, but because you've got this common ground, you'll grab a cup of coffee and then you'll just talk shop and the same rules will apply some more, some less to your nation, your industry but this love for YouTube and helping each other is real. That's why these guys meets up and that's why they do it.
Speaking of New York, because obviously this is your place, I've got an important question. If you could put something on a huge billboard in the middle of Times Square, what message do you want everyone to understand or see?
Dan Currier:	You know, there's a saying that I've kind of picked up not really only specific to YouTube, but I've carried it with me for years and that is life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. I think that as, especially in YouTube, because people get frustrated when they don't see the results, realize that mindset is such a significant ingredient to success in anything. Having the positive mindset, understanding that the journey is a process and being able to roll with the punches so to speak, and just continue moving forward I think can be super powerful in YouTube and in life.
Liron Segev:	Love it, love it, love it. I think mindset is what most of this journey is about. Once you have the right attitude, the right understanding that things really, really change. Dan, as we wrap up, if people want to get a hold of you, they want to follow you on social media, this is my plug myself moments. Yeah, go for it.
Dan Currier:	You can find me on YouTube atCreator Fundamentals, at my website atcreatorfundamentals.com. If you want to come hang out in Upstate New York, you can go topeopleofvideo.com, love to have you there. On Twitter and Instagram it's also Creator Fundamentals as well, so easy to find out there.
Liron Segev:	Fantastic. The show notes will be here with all the links, so everything we've spoken about will be on the blog post so that if you missed anything, it's a simple click away. Dan, thank you very much for making the time and sharing your knowledge with us. We look forward to seeing you and seeing your event a huge, huge success because anything that we can do to promote people getting together and talking about YouTube, well, that's a great, great thing in my mind.
Dan Currier:	Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

How to Stand Out as a Creator on YouTube: TubeTalk Episode 165
How do you stand out as a YouTuber when almost every single genre is being dominated by other creators? How do you can break into an industry and still make it?
In this week’s episode of TubeTalk, the YouTuber’s podcast, we're going to be diving right into that topic. If these are questions you've been wrestling with, then this episode is for you!
In this podcast you will learn:

Our guest this week is Sidney Diongzon, a creator that’s rocking the photography and videography content on YouTube, a space which is hugely competitive and ridiculously saturated. With nearly82,000 subscribers on YouTube, he is quickly developing his reputation as a force to be reckoned with, and is attracting major brand deals along the way. How is Sidney doing that? And how is he getting those brand deals? Tune into the podcast and dive into his story!
How to Stand Out in a Crowded YouTube Space
Sidney realized early on that to stand out on YouTube you have to be you, because there's only one of him; there's only one of you; and there's only one of everybody. With so many millions of creators on the platform, viewers often gravitate towards you as a person and how your personality shines through. Your going to be sharing your tips, tricks or opinions, but you're doing it in your way.
Viewers often turn towards platforms like YouTube, Instagram, or Twitter because they want to see something different and something unique. If they see something that's not polished, or contains the odd blooper, that's relatable. Whether you're looking for a tutorial, or you just want to be entertained, I think people are just drawn to people, which is why I think YouTube is such a massive platform for that kind of stuff. YouTube is about entertaining, and informing, but mainly it's about you just being you.
Tune into this week's TubeTalk podcast to learn how to stand out as a creator on YouTube. Huge thanks to Sidney for his insights and advice - don't forget to subscribe to his YouTube channel, and follow him onTwitter,Facebook, andInstagram.

How to Turn Your Passion into a Killer YouTube Career: Full Transcript
Liron Segev: Josh, thanks for making the time to be here.
Josh Horton:	Of course, thanks for having me.
Liron Segev:	Josh, you have quite an interesting story. For those who don't know, how would you do Josh in a tweet?
Josh Horton:	In a tweet, oh boy. After I graduated college my plan was to be a professional juggler. I was doing that but then I also started working for a social media agency part-time. That turned into full-time and then my juggling career kind of fell by the wayside and before I knew it, I was a manager at a social media agency. Then when I turned 25 I quit that job to focus 100% on juggling but I'd learned so much about social media I also started to grow a social media channel for fun, mainly on Instagram at that point.
Fast forward a couple years and now I am not done performing but juggling as a performance, as an income is a side thing and now social media is my full-time thing.
Liron Segev:	It's a good thing that Twitter has 280 characters.
Josh Horton:	That's a long tweet, yeah.
Liron Segev:	Okay, but there's a whole bunch of interesting points here where you were going in a certain direction, you decided to stop that, focus on that career.
Josh Horton:	Sure.
Liron Segev:	Then you went back to the original thing and all this juggling became a side hustle thing.
Josh Horton:	Yeah, sort of. If you want to be successful you have to follow what's making you money but you also have to follow what you're enjoying, and so I've done both of them where right now I'm loving what I'm doing and I'm making money, which is great so it's a win.
My degree was in Entrepreneurial Studies, how to be an entrepreneur, how to own your own business, how to follow those dollar signs while being your own business and I think I've done a good job of tracking what's going to be best. My plan has changed multiple times in my young adult life but I'm trying to always be adaptable and follow those signs.
Liron Segev:	And following your passion as well because that seems to be the driving force underneath all of this.
Josh Horton:	Yeah, I've loved everything ... I quit my job. My job was okay working in social media, on the brand side, but anything that involves what I'm doing I love it.
Liron Segev:	Did you find that having that brand experience and having that background, did that help you with growing your own social media and doing those brand deals?
Josh Horton:	It definitely helped me growing my own social media, especially off the bat. I started just on Instagram because I had no plans of being a YouTuber, no plans on being even an influencer. I was just like, "Hey, I like Instagram and it would be fun if I had some followers, just to have followers, to show off to my friends or whatever.
Around that time was right when video had just come out. For our brands we were almost doing exclusively super branded content, which obviously I wasn't a big fan of for an Instagram account but it taught me how to take your content a little bit next level. When videos were first coming out everyone was just filming in the app and so the fact that it had music or I was editing together montages or something was not groundbreaking but most people weren't doing it.
In the early days of Instagram video I was able to grow a following pretty quickly just with my juggling and trick shot videos.
Liron Segev:	It made you stand out because you weren't yet another me too doing something that everybody else was doing.
Josh Horton:	Exactly.
Liron Segev:	You found your own voice, you found your own way of doing it, and that obviously really struck with your community.
Josh Horton:	Right. Then, where I was also able to find some success was I knew that people didn't want to watch a juggler. Juggling is what I've done my entire life but I've been able to branch out into world records, nine juggling world records and then trick shots too. I've been throwing things accurately my whole life and then when I was trying to create more engaging, more relatable videos to other people, I knew trick shots would be an easy way to do that and turns out I'm very good at them.
Liron Segev:	Once again, tapping into something that you're good at, finding your passion, and just sharing it with the world.
Josh Horton:	Exactly.
Liron Segev:	There seems to be a community that really, really responds to that.
Josh Horton:	Definitely.
Liron Segev:	Take me through the time when you said, "Okay, there's this thing called YouTube, I know it, maybe I should transition towards that." What was that mindset like, why did you make that change?
Josh Horton:	Right. That goes back to what we were talking about before of me wanting to enjoy this life and be able to make a living doing it. This was when I was still very much a performer, so I was doing a lot of NBA college halftime shows, corporate events during my juggling show and then I had probably 150,000 followers on Instagram. I'd obviously come into a couple brand deals and I was like, "Oh wow, you can make a living on social media!.
I knew that from working in the industry but that was never a goal of mine. I'd fallen into a couple of these brand deals, made a few bucks. I was like, "Man, it'd be really cool if I could make a living just doing these internet videos." Took a look at the industry and brand deals are great but they come and go, and they can go for a very long time where you have nothing and so you can't depend on them. I knew once you have a good YouTube following you can have that Ad revenue, which is much more steady, much more reliable, quote unquote reliable as we've all learned.
I knew YouTube was what I needed to do and I knew it was going to be a big undertaking. That was about two and a half years ago and I had probably, I think it was probably 10,000 subscribers just from being a juggler and posting videos when I was younger in the juggling community. I, again, was wanting to branch out not being just a juggler so when I started taking YouTube seriously I was doing world record Wednesdays, and I'm still doing that. Every Wednesday I've broken a world record for the last two and half years and I haven't missed an upload.
Liron Segev:	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, just stop there. Every Wednesday you break a world record?
Josh Horton:	Break or set, yeah.
Liron Segev:	Wow, that's a lot of records.
Josh Horton:	It's been a lot. It's a thing where I'm like I never know when I'm going to run out or if I'm going to regret this one day. Some days I do regret it but it's such a good series that the fans love. To get the response that you just gave it's a one sentence, better than my long tweet at the beginning when people say, "What do you do on your channel?" "I break a world record every Wednesday," that's a very easy elevator pitch.
Liron Segev:	That's a taggage right there.
Josh Horton:	I started just doing once a week so world record Wednesdays was the entire channel for nine months or so and then I started posting a little bit more so now I'm at three times a week. The last two years I've been doing three times a week.
Liron Segev:	How do you find what this week's record is going to be? Is there a book that you're ticking off going from A to Z?
Josh Horton:	No. There's a couple of places, the Guinness World Records Database online which has tons of stuff. They have stuff that has been set and there's an existing record but then they also have all these things that they have in their database that no one's attempted. They've laid out the rules and the minimum for it so we're able to say, "Hey, this is in the Guinness World Records Database, there has not been a record set yet. Their minimum for this record is so-and-so," yeah. I'm all about entertainment. I do have 16 official Guinness World Records titles.
Liron Segev:	Oh, for the record, just to be clear.
Josh Horton:	Just for the record. Sorry ladies, I'm married. Yeah, for the most part it's just entertainment for YouTube at this point. Having the world record Wednesday every Wednesday, it puts it in a category form where it makes brainstorming easier but also harder. I know what my realm of, it has to be a world record so that narrows it down but also, two and a half years in, a little bit more difficult. My goal for it as we do feature people a lot, other people, other talented people.
Liron Segev:	Oh, I see, you bring in other talent?
Josh Horton:	Yeah, pretty often, especially for world record Wednesdays. We'll feature someone who is the world's best. We did a girl who has whips so she can remove Jenga blocks with whips. She's super accurate with whips.
Josh Horton:	We've done basketball people, we've done a guy who has a trained dog, all sorts of stuff. My goal for the channel is to get big enough to where people people are hitting me up all the time asking to be on the channel for the new world record, demonstrate their skill. We're not quite there yet but we're hitting up people all the time to try to get them as guests and the fans love that too because they're tired of seeing me, basically.
Liron Segev:	There's 52 Wednesdays a year. It's not a big number, not in terms of massive, but you still have to find enough talent who can actually do it.
Josh Horton:	Yeah, yeah.
Liron Segev:	Do you film the whole process if they succeed or fail or do you just give the highlight reels of, "Hey, here's the final shot."
Josh Horton:	No, we always show the process, that's kind of been another thing for the channel. The other thing, if I was to categorize my channel it would be a trick shot or sports channel unlike Dude Perfect. Dude Perfect puts together the most epic, perfect video of trick shots and that's not our style. We show the misses, we show the process, we show all of that.
Liron Segev:	Keeping it real.
Josh Horton:	Yeah. We love to show everything that happens, everything that goes into it and bring our fans along for that journey.
Liron Segev:	You've done Instagram, you've now moved across to YouTube, you're building a community. What kind of tips would you have for us if somebody is thinking, "Hey, I've got the skill," maybe something that's not your typical YouTube thing. How would I start getting myself into that mindset that, actually, the skill that I have people would want to see it?
Josh Horton:	There's a couple parts to that. I think part of it is showing the process, it's showing the personality. People only care about the skill to a certain degree once you get past that immediate community. If you like yo-yos, if you can be a great yo-yo player you can gain all of the yo-yo followers in the world but that number is going to stop at one point and then you're not going to be able to make a living doing it.
I know there's a lot of skateboarding channels that have tons of fans that are not skateboarders, they just love the process. They love seeing it, they love the personalities. I've done that with juggling but I also, I acknowledge that people weren't going to watch a juggling channel. I knew that juggling wasn't going to be something that applied to the masses and I've always loved sports. I love trick shots and so I don't feel like I'm betraying myself by not making a juggling channel because I still love what we're doing.
I think I did take, from the beginning, taking YouTube seriously with World Record Wednesdays I was like, "People are not going to watch a juggling channel. I need to branch out, I need to do something beyond what I'm just doing." I think the other thing would be to find something that is on brand with what you do on brand with your skill and then, yeah, just try to branch out a little bit, that would be more for the masses.
Liron Segev:	I love Mike Boyd's channel, it's all about who he is, learn quick, and so his are all just learning skills. He's not skilled in one specific thing but his channel is about learning skills, which I love. Do you ever do teaching videos, how to's?
Josh Horton:	I have a three ball tutorial online, it has 750,000 views, which is good for my channel but it's one of the things people are searching for it so they find it but people ask for tutorials all the time and it's just doesn't make sense for the channel anymore.
I've even thought about doing a separate channel for just tutorials or having a library of tutorials with a paywall, yeah. I'm still processing that, yeah.
Liron Segev: What about merch and things of that nature?
Josh Horton:	We're working on Merch, yeah, we've been doing Teespring but we want to take it a little bit next level, I think, soon so we'll see. I do have a juggling store which does pretty well so I do sell juggling props and all sorts of other stuff as well; boomerangs, yo-yo's, unicycles, all sorts of stuff at jugglingwarehouse.com.
Liron Segev:	I think that's what people want, is they want to be part of the community and being part of the community is actually owning a piece of that community. If it's a matter of supporting the creator by being able to do that, then why not?
Josh Horton:	I love that ... It's not a juggling channel but I'm inspiring tons of people that juggle. I get messages almost daily saying they learned to juggle because of me and they bought their first set of balls. My most sold item is my beginner set of juggling balls and we sell multiple a day. It's a cool thing to be able to, to be giving back to the community where I started, all of this started because of juggling so I do like that.
I have had internal struggles like, "Am I giving up on juggling, am I betraying my talent and my passion that I started with?" I don't think I am because I'm just being smart about all of it and I'm still loving what I'm doing.
Liron Segev:	As we wrap up, what's got you really, really excited at the moment?
Josh Horton:	Well, YouTube has finally been taking off. I say that with an asterisk, we'll have a crazy week. Overall, YouTube has finally been doing well. I think in the last six months we've gone from 200,000 to 400,000 which has been great.
Liron Segev:	Wow, wow, congratulations.
Josh Horton:	Thank you. First 100k took a long time and even the second 100k took a while but the last 200 have come pretty quickly, which has been exciting.
Liron Segev:	Have you found that you're finally in your groove, you found your niche, you know what works.
Josh Horton:	You know what works, for the most part. It's still frustrating sometimes. We had my most viewed day of the channel ever and then six days later I had the lowest viewed day of the channel in nine months, which just doesn't make sense to me. Overall, the lows are much higher than they used to be so that's good, we're moving in the right direction and still gaining subs everyday so that's good.
Liron Segev:	That's the whole thing of YouTube, just when you think you've got it figured out, you just don't. Or they go ahead and they change yet another thing.
Josh Horton:	Yep.
Liron Segev:	If people want to find you, they want to get ahold of you, what's the best way so we can have these in the show notes so nobody has to miss anything
Josh Horton:	The YouTube channel isJosh Horton. Juggling Josh is my handle onTwitter, andInstagram, and my juggling stuff isjugglingwarehouse.com.
Liron Segev:	Fantastic. Josh, thanks very much for your time.
Josh Horton:	You bet. Thank you.

How to be Successful as an Entertainer on YouTube: Podcast Snapshot
Chris Turner:On my YouTube channel, I post videos of my live performances because they are almost entirely improvised. I make them up on the spot, and I am blown away by how people actually enjoy it. There's that initial shock from an audience who doesn't know what I do and think "Oh, wow, although he's a posh white British guy, he can actually rap."
Also, one of my favorite things is my YouTube commenters say, "I love that I learn something every time I watch your video." And that's quite cool because I was very lucky to have a very privileged education and so I feel I get to share things I've learned with people.
Liron Segev: Do you use your channel purely as an advertising platform to say, hey, look what I can do?
Chris Turner: It definitely started out like that. I used to just put videos up every now and again, like stand up videos that went viral and did well. I would just put them up and send them to promoters because you need a platform for someone to see a video and it was free so of course, I used it.
And then when I started gigging regularly at clubs that had video recording equipment I started thinking, oh, these raps are ephemeral, they last for that show. But I can put them online and people who like me can see them and maybe there's a chance that one of them will take off and I'll make more fans.
Liron Segev: So has that evolved over time, are you kind of finding that you're using the platform slightly differently now?
Chris Turner:So now it's a marketing tool in the sense that I have been lucky enough to amass quite a loyal fan base. People who will watch every video and critique videos and pick their favorite parts and say, oh, for me, this is your best one.
And then within the videos, I'm able to say, "Hey, you should come and see me live." Or I can say, "I'm coming on tour." With the community features that YouTube has, I can crowdsource ideas for my freestyle raps then release content around that based on the most popular suggestions."
The reason I got into comedy is because I performed on stage at a gig and I thought, wow, this is amazing. Being on stage is my happiest place. So the fact that I can use YouTube to bring people to those live shows is really cool.
Liron Segev: What I love about YouTube is the fact that you can perform in LA, upload a video about that performance and reach a global audience. People can connect with you, wherever they are.
Chris Turner:I also add closed captions to my YouTube videos because people were asking, "Hey, I don't speak English as a first language, it would be great if we have subtitles." And I see that 5 to 10% of viewers turn on the subtitles, so that's useful for them.
Liron Segev: One of the biggest skills a content creator can have is to tell a good story. And the thing that you do really well is telling a good story. Do you think that this is a skill that any content creator can learn?
Chris Turner:I think by virtue of being a stand-up comedian you learn storytelling skills.Storytelling is an engaging skillthat we need to harness because if there's a beginning and an end, viewers will stick around for that end.
Liron Segev: For those who have never watched your videos, where can somebody find you?
Chris Turner: Check out a video first, go to the YouTube channel, and if you like what you see then please subscribe and then follow. If you like it to the point you want to see it live, great. I have shows on sale, I have a mailing list on my website,christurnercomedy.com. Sign up for the mailing list and I'll essentially just direct email you when I'm in your city.

Title: How to Grow Your YouTube Channel Fast and For Free!

How to Grow Your YouTube Channel Fast and For Free!
So you've set up your YouTube channel, cranked out a couple of videos, got your first few subscribers, some views, and you’re starting to get an idea of what all of the YouTube analytics data means. Now it's time to unleash your secret weapon.
Disclaimer Klaxon!This post is all about vidIQ, our Chrome extension. So if you haven't got it already, stop reading, anduse this linkto download it and install it on your computer. We know that you are just starting out on your YouTube journey, so we're not trying to cash in on you as soon as possible. We wanna give you that kickstart to help grow your channel, and build an audience. Hey, it’s what we do.
YouTube Channel Analytics: Access the Numbers in Real Time
Let’s start with some YouTube numbers. With the new YouTube Studio you get a snapshot of how your individual videos are performing. But what if you could get an overview of how your entire channel is performing? Well that's exactly what the vidIQ real time stats bar can help you with! Using this feature, you can access stats for the last 60 minutes, the last 48 hours, the last seven days, Watch Time for the last seven days, and subscribers in total on your YouTube channel.

Of course, you can access Channel stats via YouTube Analytics, but VidIQ’s real time stats bar allows you to see the data whether you are on the search page, or on a watch page, or on a YouTube home page. We always show you the real time analytics, and for someone like me who's got analytics obsessive compulsive disorder, I always wanna check those numbers and I can see them wherever I am on YouTube. It’s a much-loved feature on the VidIQ Chrome extension - and it’sabsolutely free. But we're not quite done there because if you like graphs as much as you like numbers, well all you need to do is mouse over the real time stats bar, and you get a breakdown of just how well your videos have been performing and your channel over the last seven days.
Also, for YouTube channels who haven’t yet reached the monetization requirements of four thousand hours, we’ve also added an additional metric in the real time stats bar which tracks your Watch Time over the last 12 months. Once you've reached those requirements, this metric automatically disappears. So if you wanted this tool for no other reason than to find out just how close you are to monetization, this is why you should download VidIQ.
YouTube Videos: Likes to Dislikes Ratio
You'll also notice when you download the vidIQ Chrome extension, that all of your videos will now have percentage numbers next to them. This is essentially the likes to dislikes ratio on any video on YouTube. This data can be useful for a number of reasons:
For your Channel, this VidIQ feature will show when the likes ratio falls below 90%, and when the ratio falls below 70%.
YouTube Research: Find Out About the Next Big Trend
The big gaming trend on YouTube at the moment is Fortnite, but what is the next game on the horizon? A lot of gaming creators are gravitating towards a game called Apex, or Apex Legends, and we know that to have a better gaming performance, you want to increase your frames per second, or FPS. So, let’s do a search for ‘Apex Legends increase FPS’, and see what the VidIQ extension can do with that.
The first awesome feature is the ‘subscriber count’ next to different Channels. This is hugely important as it can help identify windows of opportunity. Just having that little of information can let you know whether it’s worth producing content on as a gamer interested in Apex Legends. Another feature, ‘Search Companion’ will give you further data such as the average number of subscribers for the Channels that appear on these search rankings, and the average age of the videos. Both very useful for finding current trending topics.
Then we have VidIQ’s legendary ‘Keyword Score.’ This gives you a general indication of competition versus volume, or supply versus demand. If there are a lot of people searching for a term and not that many videos being supplied, again, this tells us that we should be making videos on that topic. If you want to drill deep down into the keywords and research them further, we have another awesome tool called ‘Enable Inline Keywords,’ which highlights the video tags the creators have used on videos around this topic.
As a creator, you can use this feature to determine whether you still think there is value in this keyword, whether this game is going to become more popular, and if you can establish content in that search term before it gets more popular. That kind of insight is incredibly helpful in creating evergreen content. If you like the keywords you find, you can simply mouse over the keywords, click on the paperclip to the right, go to your own video and paste them in. Or you can use the keywords as a springboard for your own ideas generation.
VidIQ Video Scorecard
The VidIQ video scorecard gives you all the information you need about every single individual video on YouTube. As well as data on social engagements, you can take a deep-dive into the search engine optimization generated around the video such as tags, titles and descriptions. There’s also a video optimization checklist so you can see if the creator has missed any important steps. If you look at your own videos through this video scorecard, you can see even more information.
Did you know the vidIQ tool can help you with editing and uploading? Straight off the bat we've got character limit features. Did you know that you can only have a hundred characters in your title? Also, it’s good to know you can have five thousand characters in your description, and five hundred characters in your tags. Why YouTube doesn't alert you that you’ve gone over your limit by default is beyond me, but we're helping you out there. Oh, and we also help you add emojis to your title (but If you are going to do this, just make sure that you add them towards the end of your titles so that it doesn't mess up the keyword indexing from YouTube). You can also use VidIQ to create a tags template, or organize your tags.
VidIQ can also help you evaluate whether your tags, titles and descriptions are effective for your video. It’s called the ‘SEO’ score, and marks your video out of 50. and the higher you can get to 50, the more potential your video has to reach an audience. The tool will also prompt you in terms of ensuring you’ve added cards, end screens, and closed captions. It’s all incredibly useful stuff to make sure that your video is in tip top shape before you publish it.
VidIQ Channel Audit: Find Out How Your Video Content is Working
One of the most powerful tools we have here at vidIQ is the Channel Audit. On ourYouTube Channelwe do a live stream every Tuesday where we audit people's channels, but as a creator consider this feature your very own 24/7 YouTube channel audit expert, which tells you all sorts of information about your channel.
For example, it can identify the general health of your channel, and the type of content to double down on if it’s consistently doing well for you. It will also give you information about Watch Time, audience retention, YouTube Playlists, top search terms, end screens, card clicks and so on.
As for how badly your channel is doing, we give you that information as well. So content that could use work, the ones with the average lowest view time, the one with terrible likes to dislikes.
VidIQ YouTube Channel Management: Invaluable Features for Creators
As you start to upload content on your channel, people will start to perceive you as an expert and want to ask you questions. If you're focusing on a particular topic, you may be asked the same question over and over again, and you kind of want to respond to that but not type out this response over and over again. Auto-generated responses can help you a lot.
For example, a viewer may thank you for sharing useful info and you’ll want to thank them in return. With the VidIQ comment template, we’ve created a long series of responses for all sorts of different questions we get here. One of more popular comments from us is responding “You’re Welcome” and automatically adding the viewer’s username. Automated responses means you can work through more comments more quickly, especially if you're getting hundreds of comments a day. I use this for at least one or two hours a day responding to as many comments as possible. This one tool, which is free of cost, has saved me hundreds, if not thousands, of hours managing the vidIQ channel.
With regards to YouTube Channel management, another thing to keep an eye out for is this vidIQ utility button which you'll find on many different pages. It does many different things depending on where you are. For example, on the video manager page, for an individual video, if I click on the button, it allows me to do things like copy cards or end screens to then put then onto other videos, saving you time there. You can also use the thumbnail editor (if you're not yet proficient with professional programs such as Photoshop) to start you off with creating custom thumbnails.

How to Generate 300,000 Subscribers for Your YouTube Channel
We are pleased to announce that ourvidIQ YouTube Channelhas reached an incredible arsenal of (at time of writing) 304,131 subscribers! What did we learn from the journey? This is not going to be a perfect list of how-to tips and tricks to get to 300,000+ subscribers. These are my personal views and opinions from a genuine YouTube enthusiast.
Custom Thumbnails are KEY to Success on YouTube
I have made a lot of YouTube videos. I think around about 1,500 at this point. But for a very long time there is something I always neglected because I wanted to make the video and just get it out there onto YouTube. What I didn't spend much time on was thumbnails. A lot of channels have questionable thumbnails, which doesn't do their YouTube brand any favours, but since vidIQ began focusing on the very best thumbnails for our YouTube videos, our click-through rates have increased from 2.5% to 5% in just one year. That's much more views for effectively the same amount of work, just doing it better. Just as readers judge books by their covers, viewers judge videos by their thumbnails. If you can improve your thumbnails that can have a massive and positive impact on the entirety of your channel.
Improve Something by 1% on EVERY YouTube Video You Create
Something I am a strong advocate for, is striving to improve with every video that you make. Whether it is thumbnails, lighting, camera presence, voice narration or editing, you should always be looking for that 1% where you can get better. Trying to improve 100% every single video is going to drive you insane. But if you can come away from every single video thinking, I like that new thing that I tried there. Or that was some really tight editing, or I like the way I presented at that particular point in the video then that is one more step in the right direction.

Experiment With Your Content as Often as Possible
This next tip may fly in the face of YouTube experts and indeed myself recommend. And that is to experiment as often as possible. Now the reason I say this is because it comes from a foundation of consistency. If you are a regular visitor to vidIQ, you should have a general sense of the type of content that we create. We want to help educate you on your YouTube journey. Get more views, more subscribers, grow your channel, ultimately and potentially earn an income from it. I've been doing that for a couple years now here at vidIQ. Showing you how to use all of our tools and general tips about getting more views and subscribers.
But we decided to do last year was to follow YouTube news stories a little more closely and report on them if we found them interesting to our audience. It's why we jumped on ‘YouTube Hashtags’ as soon as they came out and the reason we rank number one for that search term now.
Going Viral: PewDiePie vs T Series on YouTube
And then we come toPewDiePie versus T-Series. This started out as an experimentation in fame hacking. Seeing if we could latch on to a trending topic and add our own unique analytical spin on things. We didn't realize it at the time but we'd stumbled on some viral content. Now while we we're experimenting, we also practice what we preach. When those videos started to do really well, what else could we do but double down on them and make more content on the already successful stuff on our channel.
YouTube Watch Time: How we Increased Our Numbers
Now people may say that it's all down to PewDiePie versus T-Series stuff. And while I agree it has helped a lot, it's not what we are banking our channel on. These are the baseline numbers I'm more interested in. The day-to-day watch time hours that have increased around 75% in the last nine months. Outside of the viral hits, this is our bedrock. Our subscribers, our fans, the people who are watching this video and are invested in a channel at a much deeper level than anything our PewDiePie versus T-Series content could ever achieve.
Now as is always the case, when you start to create alternative content to what your community is used to, you will get push back. And we have here at vidIQ. But here's the ironic thing, we haven't produced less content than what we normally would do, in fact we're doing more content. On ourYouTube channel, we're doing videos on a Monday, live stream on a Tuesday, news on Wednesdays and Thursdays. And beginner's guides on Fridays. What's changed is we're creating a lot more content that includes stuff about PewDiePie versus T-Series. And that is bringing in a lot more exposure for the channel and building a bigger community for the stuff that we're really interested in. Which is helping you grow your channel.
Now I know this post is not full of really useful tips and tricks. Make better thumbnails, make viral videos. That's hardly going to help you day to day. But consider this my open letter to the vidIQ community. This is the type of stuff I learnt in my last nine months getting from 200 subscribers to 304,131 subscribers.

Title: How to Get More YouTube Views: 20x Increase in 2 Weeks!

How to Get More YouTube Views: 20x Increase in 2 Weeks!
Many new YouTube creators have serious concerns like: it's too late to start a channel in 2019, my topic on YouTube is too saturated, I'll never be able to compete with the big boys, or my channel’s too small it'll never get shared on YouTube. All of this is absolute rubbish and I've been waiting for an opportunity to show you how it is still possible to start a channel in 2019 and be successful.
This video is all sparked from something that we do on a regular basis here at VidIQ. We audit channels on YouTube for free 11 a.m. PST every single week (make sure you join us for that). One of the channels we listed recently made me go wow, this is what I've been trying to tell video creators for years and it still works.
How a New Tech Channel Generates More YouTube Views
‘Home Tech’ is a YouTube tech channel like many that have come before it. and the channel description tells us that it reviews smartphones, tablets and overheard tech. Now if you're a regular visitor to VidIQ especially thelive streams, I know what you're about to say. That's all very well, smartphones, tablets, home tech, but where is the focus, where's the niche?

If you think that the channel’s focus is not specific enough, you’re absolutely right. If your first video is about a Lava Lamp and your ninth video is about a wireless doorbell and your 17th video is about a Black & Decker Multipro two in one cordless vacuum cleaner, you are going to get a confused audience not knowing what to expect next. Now for a new channel this is perfectly acceptable, the video creator is trying to find their feet on a platform. Learn how to make videos and publish them and they're in the hustle stage. They're trying to find out what content they like making which resonates with an audience.
And in the early stages of this channel, they had some success. Incredibly, their second video on a gas meter got 5,000 views. But what did they do next? A video about Google Home Hub which does nothing. Then a video about a thermostat that did well. Then a video about a tablet that does even better. A follow-up video to that tablet that doubles of views again. Then a video about a light bulb that somehow does even better. Another video about a smart meter that doesn't do as well, followed by a video on a smart Samsung device that completely tanks.
So I was curious - here’s a new channel making videos about fairly different tech products and it’s getting good views. That leads me to two conclusions; either the video creator was playing around with Google AdWords, just to artificially inflate the viewing figures a little bit but legitimately of course, or the video creator was strategically targeting a couple of very niche areas such as a specific tablet or smart energy thermostats and working out which one would be most successful for that channel. I think it was probably a combination of a two. But let's continue to see where this video creator goes on their journey.
Find Your YouTube Channel Focus
It continues on the theme of random bits of tech until we hit a breakthrough video on a mobile phone. 17,000 views for a small channel is a hit. and quite rightly the video creator follows this up with another video but that one absolutely tanks. Now I would have liked to have seen this video creator have a couple more attempts at this keyword and this device but given that the second video did really poorly and the lights of dislikes ratio is relatively low, maybe the video creator lost their confidence on the topic. So let's move on. The next set of video see reviews of smartcams, a kitchen vacuum sealer and of a tablet video, a quick revisit of that phone which does okay, some headphones, smart energy savers and that vacuum cleaner. So I think it's pretty clear at this point that the video creator is basically reviewing anything that they buy for their own house. And you know what, that is absolutely fine.
As a new video creator you can't expect brands to just send you products to review. We've always said that this shouldn’t be a barrier to entry, you just work with what you have. And the next thing this creator gets, changes absolutely everything. Aaaah, the Samsung Galaxy Tab s5e. You've all heard of it, right? No, me neither. I thought Android tablets disappeared five years ago. Anyway, this is a brand new tech device and a trending one at that.
OurVidIQ Research Toolsclearly illustrate this. High search volume, low competition score. That's a keyword of interest. Click on the keyword tag itself from one of these videos and this launches the VidIQ keyword inspector, where we can see the keyword started to trend a few weeks ago, and interest is peaking now. That's a keyword of great interest. What the video creator did a month ago was create a preview video on this tablet. Now given that this video has a very low likes and dislikes ratio, people didn't react to it very well. But it did give the video creator more views than they've had in any of the previous five to 10 videos. So that was an indication of some kind that YouTube did like this content. The audience just wasn't that keen. However, and quite rightly, the video creator pressed on and released an Unboxing video. Not only was that much better received in terms of ratings, it brought in lots of views too.
Now a legitimate question you might be asking at this point is how does a channel with a couple of hundred subscribers, get a video with 8,000 views when it might be competing against big tech channels. And I think the answer is all to do with timing. I had a quick check to see when the device was officially released and Google tells me it was April of 26. But this creator was able to release an Unboxing video six days before that. Being able to create content before or during a release date of a product, show or service, gives a creator a huge boost. Because while information is scarce, the people who are searching for that information will consume every resource they can find.
There's nothing particularly special about this video. A seven-minute top-down recording of unboxing a product, it's been done thousands of times before and done better. But here's a principle I've talked about before, most successful channels are bigger, better and before anyone else with the content. This creator has one of those elements. Their video was before most of a competition. And when you have a video on your channel it's done really well and you're before the rest of the competition, there's only one thing you can do. Make more content as soon as possible.
Double Down on YouTube Content That Works!
You may have heard us refer to this as the Double Down concept. And over the last two weeks that's all the video creator has done. That same keyword title Samsung Galaxy Tab s5e, followed by whatever aspect the Creator wants to investigate with a fine-tooth comb. The big YouTube channels review these devices and move on, the smaller creators provide the real value to those who have decided to buy it and use it on a daily basis.
Remember the journey so far, this channel could get 1,000 views per video or they could get 20 views per video. Now with an absolute focus on a trending topic, they are guaranteed 1,000 views and occasionally 10 times as many as that. People often ask us this question here at VidIQ, when it comes to YouTube what's more important, quantity or quality? And the answer like many things on YouTube is that it depends.
In this particular example because the video creator has a trending topic and it's not gonna last forever, quantity is more important. You want to try and get as many videos out on a topic to hit that keyword over and over again and it's working for this channel. If there is less time sensitivity about your content then obviously quality is more important. I know we've specifically talked about tech in this particular case of it but you can apply this strategy to any topic on YouTube.
There is almost always something to talk about or something to talk about in a completely new way. And when you find the videos that hit, don't go on to something else. Really just nail down on up topic and grow your channel. For small channels, this is the quickfire hack way to get more views and build an audience.
So come on, don't tell me that it's too late to start a YouTube channel in 2019 because this channel has just proved you can go from hundreds of views a day to thousands of views a day. I have no doubt that you work hard, you've just got to think smart as well.

Winning on YouTube: The Basics
YouTube is a search engine, which means people go there to do searches for the content they want to watch. They want to be entertained, they want to know how to do things, they want to understand things about the project they're about to do, or the product they're about to buy. They go to YouTube to research. YouTube has a very clear mission, and that mission is to marry up your videos with what people are searching. If you do random stuff that nobody is searching for, you're simply not going to get those views.
Many of us at vidIQ actually own our own YouTube channels, and we use those channels to understand what you guys are going through, because we are going through the same thing. We know that when you randomly do stuff, it never comes out as expected. This is what happens with YouTube. We grab a camera. We randomly shoot a whole bunch of videos. We come home. We edit frantically. We think, we have a point to be made. We throw up a title, throw up a description, upload it, and go, "I hope this one works." But that really isn’t the right way to do it because no formula, or ‘recipe’ is actually being followed. It’s no wonder that the results are often random or very disappointing.
The 3 D's of YouTube Success
There's three D's when it comes to YouTube:
Discoverability. People need to discover your content - if people don’t know about you or your content you’re never going to be seen by lots of people because you didn't make it easy for YouTube to discover you.
Deliverability. Are you delivering? When somebody watches your video, are you delivering value? Are you giving them what they came here to find? Because if you are, you'll unlock the third D.
Distribution. People that love your content will share it, and YouTube is going to see that people are loving your content and will distribute your video for you. It's all about the three D's, but you've got to be discovered in order for you to deliver on your promise and in order for your videos to be distributed.
The First Key to Success on YouTube: Keyword Research
Almost every successful YouTube video starts with the creator knowing what the audience is searching for. For the purpose of this video, let’s assume they are searching for ‘chocolate cake’. With the vidIQ Chrome Extension installed, let’s go to YouTube and type that term in. You should see this screen:
The first thing to look for is the ‘Search Volume’ score. Chocolate Cake is a solid 100, which is the highest it can be. What does that mean? Essentially, lots of people are looking for chocolate cake, which is great, there is no point making a video nobody's even searching for. Now we've told you the search volume is nice and high. Perfect. Do we go ahead and just make this video now? No, not yet.
The next thing we got to look at is something called the ‘Competition Score.’ What does that mean? Well, we have a high search volume, but look at the competition! Look how many other people are delivering value on this keyword, and how many videos are being made. The ‘Competition Score’ is a solid 89, which means the odds of your ranking amongst these major videos are going to be pretty slim if you only title your YouTube video with the words "chocolate cake’.
vidIQ Tip:Ideally, find a keyword with lots of search volume, and very little competition. It's rare, but when you find it, it's amazing.
How to Know YouTube Content is Still Relevant?
For many people, the amount of views a video has generated indicates how successful it has been. For instance, this video from Tasty has generated 6.5M views to date so we can assume it has done well, right?
Yes, because it has an impressive number of views since being published in October 2017. But how many views is it still getting after all this time. With the vidIQ extension installed, you can check how many views per hour any video is still generating. Zero views per hour would strongly indicate there is no interest in this video content right now, and that’s something to bear in mind while researching content to create. While total views tell one story, views right now tells another. The 'Views per Hour' (VPH) score for the Tasty video above is 395.8, which is still very good.
There is more. Click on the ‘Historical’ tab and it will show you the video’s views over time. This will instantly show you the amount of viewer interest in the topic over time. Are people still watching? Is there still a demand for this keyword? Remember, we haven't picked up our camera yet. All we're doing now is the research. We want to be discovered, so we've got to do that research before we touch that camera. Here I can see very clearly, it's still on the up and up. People are stillreallyinterested in chocolate cake, and that’s already a good sign.
vidIQ Takeaway:You win on YouTube by making content that's relevant today.
How to Find the Best Keywords for YOUR Content
‘Chocolate cake’ is still a hugely competitive keyword, so I wouldn't create a video without further research on the topic. Let’s talk about narrowing your search down using YouTube’s own algorithm. Its ‘auto-complete’ feature is basically YouTube's way of saying, "Hey, so many people have searched for chocolate cake, but they've also searched for whatever it is." Let me show you what you do.
You type in ‘chocolate cake, and you press A. Look at these titles that are coming up. Chocolate cake ASMR. Good, that's a thing now. ASMR no talking. Twice. Chocolate cake and kool aid. Just rinse and repeat using all the letters of the alphabet for this trick.
Look at all these titles that it is suggesting to us for ‘chocolate cake A’. Essentially, it's YouTube's own algorithm that says, "Look, so many people have searched for 'chocolate cake from home without oven'. Well, isn't that a perfect title for you to make your video?" You see how I'm honing in on the perfect title, and the perfect direction for my video before I even pick up my camera?
YouTube is showing you what people are searching for. Therefore, the odds of you being discovered suddenly start to skyrocket because you're marrying up your videos with search intent. Win win.
But that’s not the end of it. YouTube is a search engine and what do we do with a search engine? We ask questions. Type ‘chocolate cake’ into the search bar, but this type preface it with ‘which’, ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘who’, ‘how’, ‘when’ or even ‘why’. Look at the suggestions that pop up that tell you what viewers are searching for!:
Solid keyword research is how you get discovered. You need to make sure that YouTube knows your video is going to answer a specific need and what better way to do it, than understanding the search volume, and competition, then immediately using the YouTube algorithm to understand what's working and what isn't working. That really is the way you start.
vidIQ Takeaway:Don't just pick up your camera and start shooting. Always, always, always start with keyword research first.
Optimizing Your YouTube Videos for the Right Keywords
Let’s take a look at how you should be optimizing your video before you publish. The first thing we look at is the title. The title is arguably the most important thing for YouTube discovery right now. If you're going to hit anything right it's the title, then description, then tags.
Think of it this way, YouTube is a search engine, and the more you can feed the search engine information about your videos it can only help. The most important thing is not to clickbait, not to mislead YouTube engine in any way because it will know. Let’s take a look at how we optimized one of our own videos for a particular keyphrase: ‘How to Grow Your Channel Fast in 2019’
We added that keyphrase in the tile, description and tags to tell YouTube in three different ways what this video is about. Basically, we’re showing YouTube via metadata what this video is about and if anybody is searching for it marry us up to that search.
Using YouTube Keyword Tags for Extra Research
Now, here’s a neat trick we want to show you. On the upload page you can add tags and see how they might perform for you in real time. With the Chrome Extension enabled, let’s type in ‘Valentine’s Day’ as a search term. The tool will start to suggest other terms, each with their own vidIQ score:
Now, if we click on the 'Valentine's Day' tag we've just added a new page opens with a new list of related keywords that immediately tell you what you should be using.
On the same new page, in the ‘Interest Over Time’ report, you can choose from the last 30 days (not recommended for once-a-year events like Valentine’s Day if you’re searching in September), from the last 365 days, or by all time.
When you add a keyword that's so highly searched for, always look at all time because it gives you a much more realistic overview. Because Valentine’s Day is a tentpole event, every single year since 2008 it's been a thing on YouTube, so the odds of it being a thing next year are pretty good. If you didn't make a Valentine's Day video, be sure that it's going to trend again next year so be prepared.
Going back to chocolate cake content, I’d be thinking about content like ‘how to make a chocolate cake for Valentine's Day for your boyfriend’, or wife, or husband or girlfriend 2020 or 202.. That’s evergreen content that will live forever, and interest and traffic will spike every single year at that right opportunity.
vidIQ Takeaway:Search for tentpole events you can create evergreen content around.
Views Per Hour: The Best Time to Publish to YouTube
Remember how we mentioned how important Views Per Hour (or VPH) was? One of the key signals that YouTube is looking for when you launch a video is what's the audience like? Do people care about this content? Are they watching a little bit or are they watching a lot? Are they sharing? Are they leaving comments? Are they giving it thumbs up? All of these are nuggets of information for YouTube to work out which video to promote. YouTube wants to help you, and show your video to lots of audiences, not just your own. It wants to discover new audiences for you, but you've got to send it the right signals. This is where the initial velocity is really important, which is why the vidIQ tool suggests the best time to publish videos to your channel.
Staying on the upload page with vidIQ install, just select the date, and you’ll automatically see the best times. In this example, we chose a Monday, and the tool suggests that peak traffic occurs at 3am and 12pm PT. To ride the wave of the 12pm spike, we suggest posting your video between 3am and 5am PT. (Don’t worry, the tool adjusts the time zone based on your location).
Why it's important to launch just before the best published time? It's because that's when your audience is online, and that’s the best opportunity you have for your video as you launch. That is beautiful signals for YouTube in watches that video takeoff because a lots and lots of people started to watch.
Optimization Checklist: Give YouTube the Information it Needs
On the upload page with vidIQ installed, you’ll also find the optimization checklist. Ticking off everything you know your video needs to send the right signals to YouTube is a huge time-saver so please make sure you use this tool every time
Recommended Tags & Videos to Gain Views From
Staying on the upload page, scroll further down and you’ll see sections called ‘Recommended Tags’ & ‘Videos to Gain Views From’. Recommended tags offer up extra suggestions for you, and if you scroll over you’ll get a pop-up that shows the competitor score and other metrics. Just click on any keyword tag to add to yours.
When we researching something on YouTube, we tend to watch more than one video, and the platform knows this and will serve up extra content on the subject for you. The ‘Videos to Gain Views From’ section suggests other amazing creators doing similar content to you, and whose videos are likely to be served up to your audience. You can see the keyword tags being used on these videos and add to your own.
Understand Your YouTube Competitors
With the vidIQ Chrome Extension installed, you’ll find a section called ‘Competitors’ on the left hand side of the upload page. Competitors are other creators publishing the same type of content as you - it’s good to know who these are so you can learn from them! You can see from the screenshot that we keep a very amicable and loving eye on our friends in the online video space and have added their channels to understand what’s working for them and what gets their audience excited. This feature really allows you to confirm if you’re on the same track because, again, YouTube is a search engine and people are definitely searching for similar content.
The Competitors tool is sorted by different time frames, and by views, views per hour (VPH), or by date uploaded, so you can really take a deep-dive into the data.
For instance, sorting by VPH will tell you what’s really working at the moment. If you keep an eye on competitor content sorted by VPH by past 48 hours, this week, this month or all time, you’ll really get an idea of what type of content is working for them.
What sort of thing should you be taking notice of here? Do their thumbnail pop? How can you make your thumbnails even better? Are there video titles long, or short? What type of content is working for them - how to’s? listicles? What trends are they jumping on that you should be aware of?
vidIQ Takeaway:DO NOT COPY your competitors - it's one of the biggest mistakes that people often make on YouTube. They compare themselves to a competitor, and they copy everything that creator does and 99% of the time it just doesn't work. We advise understanding what similar creators are doing then confirm anything in your video strategy that might be missing or could be improved.
Trend Alerts: Get Insights into What People are Watching on YouTube
Talking of trends on YouTube, in the same left-hand column you’ll find a feature called ‘Trend Alerts’. Using this feature is really a golden ticket for YouTube creators because instead of keeping an eye on the trends, you can say, "Hey, trends come to me!"
Let’s use ‘Fortnite’ as an example. Add that term as a keyword, and select a VPH Threshold of 100 views per hour. Then select how often you want to be notified of any Fortnite-focused video on YouTube that’s achieving that view metric.
Why should you care? Because you are going to get a report that confirms how content around a certain keyword is performing, and if you see a topic going from 100 views per hour to 500 views per hour and then the same videos hitting a thousand views per hour the following day, guess what? It's a trend! Keeping an eye on videos that are generating significant VPH gives you an opportunity to create your own content - and quickly.
vidIQ Takeaway:Load up those trend alerts, and let us do the work for you. We'll let you know when something hits those milestones.
Discover the Most Viewed Videos on YouTube Right Now
In the left-hand menu bar you’ll also find the ‘Most Viewed’ tool. This gives the user some insights into what’s happening on YouTube right now, but sorted by VPH, not just what’s trending onYouTube’s official page. At the exact time of writing, Disney’s official trailer for ‘Frozen 2’ is the top result on its Trending page:
Using the vidIQ most viewed tool, it’s also the top result but we can go one step further and confirm how many views per hour it’s actually generating in real time - an incredible 337.5K! How awesome is that?
This tool is great for research so you can truly uncover what videos are getting the most views on YouTube right now as the results sometimes differ from the official Trending page results. But you can also determine what content is most viewed over 48 hours, 7 days, 30 days, and in the last 6 months.
You can also filter the search results by keyword, engagement, category, location, duration and YouTube channel size. The latter is a great feature as you can choose to sort by ignoring all channels with 1 million subscribers and above, or those that have between 10 and 100,000 subscribers, which might match your channel size more closely.
YouTube Channel Audit: Find Out How You Are Really Performing
Sticking with the left-hand menu, take a look at the ‘Channel Audit tool, which does exactly what it says on the tin. You’re making videos but what’s really working for you and what isn’t? This is where the Channel Audit tool comes into play, as it’s going to give you an insane amount of information.
The first thing you're going to see is how you are performing month over month? Are you growing or shrinking? Are you getting more subscribers? More YouTube views? More Watch time? Those are the important metrics you should have at your fingertips.
Then comes ‘Content to Double Down On’ which you can confirm by VPH, engagement rate, views, and subscribers gained. Double down is an American term, and it basically means do more of this, it works!
The vidIQ tool will do this for your own channel by taking a look at your published content and confirming which of your videos are giving you new subscribers, plus other invaluable information.
As you scroll further down on the Channel Audit dashboard you’ll also discover which search terms viewers are using to find your content, what your End Screen and Card click through rates are, as well as a host of other metrics over 30, 60, or 90 days.
Publicise Your Achievements!
Going back to the vidIQ YouTube Channel, are we hitting those milestones? Are you hitting yours? We have something called Achievements that goes out, fetches your information that says, how are you doing, and allows you to share those milestones. Here’s a snapshot from our current achievements - pretty good, right?
In the tool, just pick an achievement, and open it up to reveal a new certificate that you can share it with your audience. This works especially well on social media, because your audience want to be part of your journey. How many of us do this at the moment? We see a big creator who is celebrating another milestone and we like that tweet and we retweet it. We reply back to the creator, "Hey, I was with you when you had 400 subscribers. Look how well you've done now."
Our audience loves it, why not share it your achievement with you? You should be proud of what you're doing on your channel.

The Five Big Mistakes YouTubers Make: TubeTalk Episode 164
YouTube can be frustrating. You think you're doing everything right, but perhaps you’re actually making one of the five fundamental mistakes that are derailing your channel. In this week's TubeTalk podcast we'll unpack those five common mistakes YouTuber's are making -and focus in on one on this post.
Tube Talk, the YouTuber's podcast, is dedicated to helping you become a better video creator so you can get more YouTube views, and subscribers. This week we’re very lucky to be joined by the one and only Benji Travis.
Benji is a YouTube mastermind. He's behind theitsJudysLifechannel which has over 1.6 million subscribers, as well as his own cooking channel,BenjiManTV, which has over 367,000 subscribers. He is one half of the team atVideo Influencers, and he's the co-author of YouTube Secrets, one of my favorite books. Through his multiple social media based businesses he earns a seven-figure income.

YouTube Mistake: Lack of a Clear Goal
Click on the above link to play this week's TubeTalk podcast to find out the top 5 mistakes YouTubers are making. In this post we take a look at one - a lack of clear direction and goals.
There are a lot of YouTube creators doing things right, but there are many more that aren’t doing the basics. Benji confirms that because YouTube is so big it can get very confusing so it's important to have some guidance when you first start. There are so many resources (including TubeTalk) available to teach you how to navigate this new frontier we call YouTube.
But at the end of the day, it's still a content platform, and there's still some basic stuff that creators are not getting. We’ll be taking adeep dive into all of these basics during the podcastbut let’s discuss one here: how many creators lack clarity or a clear goal of what they want to accomplish on the platform.
And that can be different for everybody, but focus is important because If you don't have some kind of clarity for yourself in terms of who you're trying to reach, what type of content you're going to stand for, what people will know you for, what your channel's going to look like, what your videos are going to be, you're going to be just all over the place.
Starting with clarity in mind, your YouTube goals become a kind of mission statement. Define what kind of content you’re passionate about and you want to share with people. Then, have a personal goal for exactly what you want to get out of being on YouTube. A lot of people just jump into it, especially young people. They just want to be famous. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's an uphill battle because what does that even mean?
People think they can start uploading content to YouTube, and then they'll be famous. Well that really isn't going to help you. But by being clear, defining what kind of content you want to create for what audience, is a goal to get you going. It's well worth determining your goal and investing time in it. It's going to save you a lot time rather than just filming random stuff online that doesn't really apply to you.

Title: How to Get More Views on YouTube From Your Subscribers

How to Get More Views on YouTube From Your Subscribers
For years, many have considered YouTube notifications both a blessing and a curse. For viewers, notifications help inform them when content comes out from their favorite creators. But for many creators who rely on this notification system, it’s been a little shaky for the past couple of years. YouTube have finally acknowledged this and are doing something to improve it.
A quick reminder of how notifications work. When a viewer subscribes to channel, a bell icon appears that gives that new subscriber the chance to personalize their notifications from that channel. Yes, I know it still seems a little daft to subscribe to a channel and then have to tap the ‘All’ option to make sure you get notifications, but that's the YouTube world we live in. That is why you will see many creators asking their viewers to not only subscribe to their channel but click on the notification bell as well.
Once you've helped your viewers jump through all of these hoops to get their notifications, is there any way that you, as a video creator, can help YouTube in distributing those notifications to those viewers? Yes!

YouTube have recently released two videos on the subject . The first video gives you a YouTube viewers perspective, explaining how to make sure your account and devices are set up so that you should receive those YouTube notifications. You can watch that videohere.
The second video from the Creator Insider channel talks a little more about the process of sending notifications, and this is the golden piece of information. And this sounds so simple, and it makes me wonder why I didn't think of this before!
One Simple Trick to Get More YouTube Views from Subscribers!
There are millions of video creators publishing tens of millions of videos on YouTube every single day which results in billions of notifications. And when do you think most of those videos are published? On the hour. In the video, they only showed this graph for a snippet of a second, but it illustrates when notifications are sent out by YouTube, and as you can see, there are massive spikes on the hour and presumably many spikes on the half hour.
It's also interesting to note how the overall volume shrinks to almost nothing during what I assume are the early hours of the morning. Now, of course, I am not suggesting that you publish your videos at 3:00 a.m. in the morning because everybody's asleep. But, what I am suggesting is that you test publishing videos at slightly unusual times. For example, if you usually publish your videos at 7:00 a.m. in the morning, try publishing them at say, 6:53am.
First of all, if we use YouTube’s graph as evidence, the notification of a published video has a much better chance of reaching subscribers instantly rather than getting stuck in a huge notifications spike on the system.
Secondly, let's say that a subscriber gets lots of notifications on the hour, wouldn't you prefer to have yours at six or seven minutes earlier to ensure you’re top of the list?
And finally, don't forget that YouTube allows creators to schedule videos at 15 minute intervals, so if you publish your video at a time such as 22 minutes or 53 minutes past the hour, you're slotting your video's go live time into a pocket of quieter notification traffic.
A video's initial view velocity can be crucial to the long-term success of that content. If you get a wave of subscribers flooding your video in the first couple of hours with views and watch time, that will send positive signals to YouTube who should then, in turn, share your content more broadly.
Want To Get More Views on YouTube?
So now you know not to post videos on the hour, but what hour of the day should you be posting your videos? Well it just so happens that vidIQ has the perfect tool to help you. It analyzes your subscribers activities and suggests when is the best time to post your content on YouTube along with a dozen other tools that will help you reach research YouTube, analyze videos, audit your own YouTube channel, and take actual steps that will help grow your channel.

4 Common Mistakes YouTubers Make (And How to Correct Them FAST!)
After auditinghundredsof YouTube channels of all sizes, I’ve noticed there are 4 common mistakes that people are still making. In this post, I’ll outline those mistakes so you don't make them.
The vidIQ Academy: Kick-start Your 2020 YouTube Journey

Members of the vidIQ family thathave upgraded to our Boost and Pro packages get immediate accessto theAcademy via this linkso you can start your YouTube success today!

The course is stuffed so full of tips, tricks and advice that it’s only for paying customers - sorry! For a quick overview of what to expect from vidIQ's brand new Academy just watch this video:

4 Common Mistakes YouTubers Still Make
Here are the basic errors I see YouTubers still making - but the good news is that you can correct them fast!
#1 Neglecting your YouTube Channel Banner
The channel banner is essentially the first thing people see. Somebody does a search, encounters your video, and clicks on it, likes what they see then they click on your name to go to your channel to get more of your content.
The first thing they see is right at the top of your page is your channel banner. Your banner needs to tell the viewer two things:
The what and the why? Those have to be conveyed visually in your channel banner, but what I see time and time again is none of those things. Don't make that mistake. Don't lose your audience right at the beginning when they're about to engage with you, but you haven't sold them. You haven't given them the reason for being here, the reason to watch your channel.
Ask yourself the question. If somebody instantly sees your channel banner then closes the page, will they remember you? Will they remember what your channel is about? Do you think we've achieved that with the vidIQ channel banner?
Whilst we talking about branding, don't forget about your thumbnails. Your thumbnails and your branding go together. I call it the‘10,000 Thumbnail Test’where if you take three or four random thumbnails that you have on your channel, you drop them into a bucket with 10,000 other thumbnails, can we go ahead and pick out just your thumbnails out of that bucket? If the answer is no, means your branding isn't consistent across all your thumbnails. If the answer is yes, means you're doing a good job.
If you are not able to design, and a lot of us are not designers, let's be honest, use a service like Canva, or buy templates online from designers who specialize in this. You can commission people to do private banners specifically for you on services like fiverr.com for example.
Or reach out to your designing buddies and say, "Hey, can I pay you for your time? Can we do a trade exchange?" Try get your channel banner to be absolutely on point. It is the business card of your channel. It tells you the what and the why. People lose so much traffic just by not doing this little tip.
#2 A Lack of Real Focus
The next mistake is not being focused, and here's what I mean by that. Imagine you're watching Netflix or Hulu or one of the streaming services. 10 minutes into the movie, a sports game pops up. You go, "Wow, that's weird. I wasn't expecting that." Then it goes back to your show, but 15 minutes later a music video pops up. You go, "Wow, what's going on? I'm trying to watch this video. Why is this coming up again and again?" And it goes back to your movie and then 15 minutes later, the sports game starts again.
You're going to get frustrated. You're going to realize, "Hold on a second, something is wrong. I'm not here for that. I'm here to watch my movie. Why am I being interrupted?" That is exactly what's happening on your channel when you don’t focus.
If you're not focused you're giving people content that's all over the place, and they get frustrated. Your subscribers subscribed because of a certain type of content. Now, when they're not getting that content, they just simply won’t watch it. But if you're going to give them content that is focused, that is niche, the stuff that they came on the channel for in the first place, odds are pretty good they're going to keep watching again, and again, and again.
I'll give you a personal example. On my technology channel, I was doing technology. Technology's pretty niche, right? Well, not really because within technology there are lots of verticals, there are lots of things within the technology sphere. I was doing lots of things. I was doing phones, I was doing gadgets, I was doing apps, I was doing cars. I was doing tech in everything.
But people were getting frustrated because they came in for certain type of content and they just weren't getting it. I thought I was pretty niche. I was in the technology sphere. But it turns out I wasn't niche enough. You've got a niche within your niche. You got to focus within your focus. The second I made that transition and that focus, I realized that people were here for certain content. Then I made more of that content. That is when my channel really started taking traction and really started growing.
Now you may be thinking "I don't want to do the same thing again and again and again. Essentially, I don't want to be pigeonholed." That is ridiculous, and let me tell you why. When you're pigeonholed, you're essentially telling the world you're the best in the world at doing your content. You're the best PUBG gamer, you're the best Fortnite tutorial helper, you're the best plumber on how to unclog your toilet. Well guess what happens? When you're the best in the world, when somebody has a problem, they're going to go to the best in the world. The one that comes to the top of mind, and they are going to go to that channel to get the solutions they're looking for.
Think of it in your own personal life. You know who to call when your car breaks down. You know who to go to when your kids get sick. You know who to go to when you have an accounting issue. You go to the best people that you have in your circle because those are the people that could help you. Now, if your accountant was also your GP, was also your creative director, was also your designer. It's weird. You don't do that. You go to the specialist in their field.
You want to be known as the best in the world for whatever content you do. Again, I'm going to tell you from personal experience on my channel. As soon as I doubled down on how to make faster Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi related products and services. My channel grew, and grew, and grew. YouTube saw me as an authoritative channel in that industry on that particular topic. When people do a search for that, my channel comes up. Now I am known as the Wi-Fi guy and people know that they're going to get those solutions on my channel.
Let me answer your next question as you're thinking about it, which is “am I suck doing the same content forever?” No. As soon as you grow, and you're going to get some traction, and you're going to start building a community, and people are going to start engaging with you for you. Being you, being the personality. Then you can start pivoting to other areas. You can grow your channel, doubling down on the same content, and giving people what are they for so they watch your videos again, and again, and again. You're going to get those subscribers, you're going to get those views and slowly you can start moving to other areas.
#3 Not Making The Videos Viewers Want to Watch
Another common mistake that I see people doing again, and again, and again is filming for hours, then editing, adding the best B-roll they could find, adding music, uploading, only to discover that nobody's watching those videos. Then they think YouTube hates me, YouTube doesn't like my content, YouTube always favors the big creators.
Newsflash, YouTube doesn't hate you. In fact, YouTube loves you because YouTube makes money based on ads. The better your content is, the more it can serve a bigger audience, and the more money it's going to make on ads. So, how do you make content that people want to consume so that YouTube will distribute your videos longer? That is the better question versus why YouTube hates me. And the answer is, do the research.
What I see people doing time and time again is filming for hours on end, editing, splicing it up, thinking of a title, getting a screenshot or a screen grab to make a thumbnail, uploading onto YouTube, and wondering why they're not getting any views. Start the other way around, do that research. Find out if people actually care about the topic that you're about to spend hours filming. Find out which angle you should actually be taking. What's your competition like? What is everybody else talking about on the same content? How are you going to be different? How could you stand out and still capture that same audience? Ask those questions first. Do thatYouTube keyword research.
Of course, you can use thekeyword research tools within vidIQ, or simply go onto YouTube, go up to the search bar and then start typing in your key phrase. Let's just say it's chocolate cake. Type in ‘chocolate cake’ and press enter. See what comes up, what are the top videos that are ranking there? Is your content going to be better than those videos? That's the first question.
Then go into your search bar again and instead of just typing in ‘chocolate cake’ or whatever your key phrase is, type in ‘chocolate cake’ space A. Then delete that and ‘chocolate cake’ space B. And delete that, ‘chocolate cake’ space C. That way you're essentially invoking the YouTube auto-complete. You'll see titles coming up again, and again, and again. Those are phrases that people have used to type into the search bar so many times that YouTube is making it easier for the next person.
Very quickly you'll be able to find topics that you can actually make videos about still within the ‘chocolate cake’, still within your niche. But something more specific, something that people are typing in. Don't forget to go to the beginning and type in how, what, where, when, why, who too!
The lesson here is do not pick up the camera until you have your title in hand. Have two, three, four titles that are going to focus your video, going to focus your shooting. You know that you're off to a winner before you even pick up that camera because you've done your research. Research, research, research, it takes work, it takes time, but it's going to save you all that headache and all those hours of creating a video nobody cares about. Go and do that research - it’s super, super important. Here’s a fantastic video about the whole keyword research process:
#4 Ignoring Your YouTube Analytics Data
Okay, so you've done your research, you know what your title is, you've shot your video. You've got the best thumbnail you can get, you got the best title you can get, and you’ve published your video. But YouTube is still not recommending your videos. What's going on?
Okay, so now you play detective; you're looking at your analytics and you're looking for clues. One of the best places to look for clues is in something calledretention. Retention basically is an indicator telling you at which point people dropped off your video. Are they watching to 20% of your video and then leaving? Or 50% of your video and then leaving? That is a very, very important signal for YouTube because it talks to the quality of the content.
Think about it from YouTube's point of view. If you have a video that's got an amazing title and an amazing thumbnail, but people are watching 1% and then leaving immediately, it gives off a signal that maybe it's a clickbait video. Maybe you're not delivering what you promised on your title and therefore YouTube is certainly not going to recommend your video. However, if your video has a 50, 60, 70% retention rate, YouTube will say, "Okay, well if people are watching it to 60 and 70%, let's try it with a different audience. Let's distribute it more, and more, and more."
The first thing I would do is I would look at the retention of my individual videos. Look at what shape the graph is in. Is it a hockey stick shape? Do people drop off right at the beginning? That tells me that I didn't capture them enough, I didn't hook them enough, I didn't deliver on my promise right from the outset. I didn't grab their attention. They came to the video, they saw the beginning and they went, "This is boring, not from me. I'm out of here." Then they leave your video.
If you see people are staying for the beginning part of your video, but they're leaving in the middle, find out why they left in the middle, at which point. In fact, in the retention graph, you can actually click on those various points and play the video at the same time. Maybe you repeated yourself again, and again, and again. Maybe you spoke about a topic for too long. Maybe it was something that went off-topic and then you've lost some of your audience. Learn from those mistakes so that you don't repeat them in your next video and then your next video.
Then finally, do they leave right at the end? Is it a sharp drop? Maybe you've already said, "Hey, my video is over." Maybe you did the whole, "Hey guys, thanks for watching. Really appreciate it." As soon as people hear that, well they know that your video is done and they’re off to the next one. Maybe you need to work on your outro.
Retention is actually divided into three, your intro, your beginning part, your middle, which is your meat and bones of your video itself, your content, and then the outro, which is the ending bit. Improve in each section. Especially the beginning so make sure that people don't leave immediately. Work on your intro, maybe cut out your intro, make it shorter. Maybe cut out those beautiful animations - people don't care about that kind of stuff, they just want that information. If you finding that's what people are dropping off, get rid of it, cut it out. Then start getting into your topic early, early on. Retention is a super, super powerful, very underrated feature that we need to pay much, much more attention to.
How Many Mistakes Are YOU Making?
The question I have for you is, how many mistakes are you currently making? And more importantly, are you going to go and fix those mistakes? So many people really want to level up their channel. They really want to get to that next level, but are not prepared to put in the work.
Don't be one of those people.

Title: Did We Clickbait YouTube? [An Unintentional Case Study]

Did We Clickbait YouTube? [An Unintentional Case Study]
One of the videos on ourVidIQ YouTube channelrecently cracked 2.5M views, and usually, that would be ahugecause for a celebration, but on this occasion, I'm not so sure. There are two fundamental questions that are wrestling with my conscience. Did I clickbait the YouTube community? And if I did, why is YouTube rewarding me for this? Allow me to explain.
Welcome to VidIQ, the YouTube tool, channel and blog that educates you on your YouTube journey. Of course, as video creators ourselves, we are also learning with every single video that we publish, and this particular one raised some very interesting moral questions.
It was never my intention to clickbait people into watching the video that now has over 2.5M views, but the general response and reaction to the video seems to be just that. Just to be clear, we never profit from any of our videos on YouTube. We don't monetize content here at VidIQ so there was never a financial aspect involved in everything that I'm about to tell you.

Clickbaiting YouTube? The Back Story
Let me explain. Say hello to the new YouTube Creator Studio, the video management and analytics suite we will all be using in 2020 whether we like it or not. The classic Creator Studio's days are very much numbered.
Now, when you think about this, it is a monumental shift for millions of video creators on YouTube. They've all been used to working with YouTube in a certain way for almost a decade, and now all of that is changing, and that creates a unique and lucrative opportunity for YouTube growth channels such as ourselves. We've capitalized on that with videos about how to delete a YouTube video, how to add subtitles to your videos, how to create a playlist, how to hide your subscriber count, etc.
Thanks to the new Creator Studio, the way you do a lot of things you’ve always done on YouTube has completely changed, and throughout 2019 we systematically worked our way through abig list of beginner's guides for the new YouTube Creator Studio, and you can see the results. VidIQ's tutorials on these topics have positioned themselves at the very top of the search rankings on the platform.
Now as of time of recording, both the classic Creator Studio and new Creator Studio can be accessed by video creators, but when YouTube turn off access to the Creator Studio, all of those old tutorials on the classic studio will be obsolete, leaving our new studio tutorials ready to clean up.
We've already made the content, and we're well-positioned on YouTube so when it turns off the old studio, we hope to do even better, and we're hoping that YouTube is going keep this studio for years to come which means that our videos on these topics could stay at the top of the search rankings for years. That’s classic evergreen content, and this is a very rare and unique opportunity for us because how often does evergreen content suddenly become obsolete?
How often do you have the opportunity to create dozens of evergreen pieces of video to replace what was there before? We've done a detailed video on this topic and our success which youcan check out here.
The Video That Went Unintentionally Viral on YouTube
One of those videos in that series was this:
Now, the video itself goes on for a couple of minutes about some fairly innocuous stuff about video formats, but it’s asingle letterin the title of that video that has caused all of this success and commotion.
This video is titled ‘How to Download a YouTube video 2019: New Method’ because it shows you how to download a video from your YouTube channel and also explains how you can download any video from YouTube to watch offline on the YouTube mobile app.
However, and I think we can all agree on this, when people search for ‘how to download a YouTube video’, they don't really want to know how to do either of those things I taught in that tutorial. They want to know how to download a video from YouTube to use however they want, which is all well and good, except it's against YouTube's terms of service. Section 5B of theYouTube terms of servicestates the following:
So unless you're using the download link in the YouTube Creator Studio or the download link from the YouTube premium service on the YouTube mobile app, you're trying to download YouTube videos in a way you're not supposed to do. And yet you're still searching for that solution on YouTube……
So what we have here is a disconnect between the value that's promised in the title of the video and the expectation of the viewer, and boy has this video paid for it in the comments. The video has over 700 comments now that mostly accuse us of clickbait, misleading the viewer into thinking we would show them how to download any video from the YouTube platform for free to use as they please.
That's the expectation, but we already know that expectation is against the terms of service, and it could be argued that it's also against YouTube community guidelines as well. Effectively, instructional theft.
But when you think about it from a certain point of view, we're doing YouTube a favor. We're showing people how to use YouTube's tools to legitimately download videos off YouTube. It's nothing illicit, illegal, or against terms of service. We are helping both viewers and YouTube, right? All of which brings us back to this single letter that in the context of downloading YouTube videos commonly refers to doing it the wrong way, whereas our video educates people on how to download a YouTube video the right way.
How the Video Title Got us into Trouble With YouTube
Now, it's not our fault that the majority of people searching for how to download a YouTube video are doing it with these ulterior motives in mind. That search term, that title shouldn't be forbidden, especially if we're doing it for the right reasons. I mean, if anything we're reclaiming this title for the benefit of YouTube.
And this is where I'm really wrestling with my conscience, is the video title misleading, is it clickbait? Yes, absolutely I agree that you could argue that the title of this video should be how to download your YouTube video, but that's why I included that little snippet of information that you can download any YouTube video if you have the YouTube premium service, and who hasn't done that in their own videos to allow them to be a little more broad and creative with their titles?
But on the flip side of the argument, viewers know what they're searching for when they want to download a YouTube video, and I know what I'm doing when I put a title like that. I'm trying to reach a much wider audience than the target audience my video might be intended for.
I keep having this argument in my head, and then I go back to the fundamental content of the video which does tell you how to download a video from YouTube. In hindsight, what I should've done to justify the title ‘how to download a YouTube video’ is explain the terms of service which only allow you to download a YouTube video with these tools from YouTube, but as you all know, hindsight is a wonderful thing for a video creator.
I have tried to fix this in the video by including more details in the video description and confirming in a pinned comment that the terms of service do not allow you to download any video you want in the way you're trying to do it because you've used the search term.
I had no idea how successful this video would end up being. As with all of the new Creator Studio beginner's guide tutorials we've made in this series, the video started off modestly, but momentum began to build and build some more and continue to build more so than any other video in the beginner guide series.
This is evergreen content in action and at its finest, and now incredibly, six months after the video was published it gets more than 10,000 views per day. I think it's important to reiterate at this point, clickbait or not, we have not monetized the content to profit from it, but I know that none of what I've just told you right now has really sunk in, has it?
All you're interested in is what happened here and here. Well, I'll tell you exactly what happened.YouTube took the video down. Yep, for many of you who believe our video is clickbait, here is your vindication. The video was removed because it violated YouTube's ‘Harmful and Dangerous’ policy, and the vidIQ channel was issued with a community guideline warning. What that basically means is that if you do something like this again, the channel receives an official community guideline strike and is restricted from posting content for a period of time.
Now, we can only assume that one of the 8,400 people who dislike this video reported it to YouTube which is well within their right, but you know what's also within our rights?To appeal that decision and we won.
So at this point, I am thinking we have vindication from YouTube that the video isn't clickbait since we won an appeal, and then the video got taken down again. The second time this happened, it seemed pretty obvious that YouTube had done a mass purge on this topic to get rid of all of the videos that were instructing users on how to break terms of service because the videos that are left in this search term suffer from the same problem as us.
All with very high dislike ratios, likely because the content educates viewers on what exactly they are allowed to do as opposed to showing viewers what they want to do, which by now we all know is against the terms of service.
__Oh, and of course we appealed the decision and won again. __
Do Clickbait Videos Attract More Views on YouTube?
All right, let's shift the focus a little bit now and let's say for argument's sake that this is deemed a clickbait video. My question now to YouTube and all of you is why is this video so successful? And does it support the notion that clickbait gets you more views on videos?
Let's take a look at the metrics. As you've already seen, the momentum of this video has been phenomenal, and that is caused by an impressive click-through rate of 13.3%. YouTube says that their typical click-through rate is between 2 and 10% so we're punching above our weight there.
However, we are already aware of the poor likes to dislikes ratio, and that would seem to suggest that it does not matter what type of engagement you get, just so long as you get some. It would also suggest that likes and dislikes metrics have little to no influence on the success of a video.
Then there is audience retention and average view duration. At 34% and 47 seconds respectively, these are numbers that defy the notion that more Watch Time and higher audience retention are key to a successful video.
I did have a very intentional strategy with this video and all of the beginner's guides that we do, and that is to frontload all of the valuable information because people are essentially searching for an answer to a question and I want to give it to them as soon as possible without all the fluff. The details come afterward, and although that does buck the trend of trying to keep people watching as much of your content as long as possible, for educational content, that does seem to work.
But of course, like a lot of things on YouTube, it all depends on what your audience wants, and for many types of video content, they want to watch a story. ‘How to download a YouTube video’ isn't necessarily a story that needs 20 minutes to be told.
So in summary, the majority of the viewers hate the video, and on average they watch it for just 47 seconds, and yet YouTube continues to pump more and more impressions into the video, driving it up to the top of the search rankings where it gets most of its traffic. Is clickbait the key to YouTube success? Is this the only metric that really matters on YouTube? I think you're expecting an answer here, and to be honest, I haven't got one. I'm still trying to work out if this video's actually clickbait or not.
Our mission here at VidIQ is to educate you on your YouTube journey, and whilst doing that, we also educate ourselves with the wonderful explorations into how YouTube works, and this video in particular certainly piqued my interest, and I hope this little story interested you.

Title: 13 MISTAKES New YouTubers Like YOU Make - and How To Avoid Them

13 MISTAKES New YouTubers Like YOU Make - and How To Avoid Them
Feeling entitled to views and subscribers. Ultimately, for a lot of creators, it's that mindset that causes them to fail when they first start their YouTube channels.
After six, nine, twelve months, they realized that it's harder than they think to get 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time, and to monetize their YouTube channels because I think those people would assume they deserved to be seen by YouTube audience. They also assume that they deserved to be paid for their work.
13 Massive Mistakes You Are Making as a YouTube Creator
In case you're wondering why we creating this post and video, it’s because we asked on Twitter what were your biggest YouTube mistakes and you responded en masse, so we thought we would discuss some of those. Which brings me on to the first of the mistakes you are probably making, even if they think you aren’t:


Mistake #1 Thinking You Deserve Immediate Success on YouTube
Until you prove your value first to your audience, and then to YouTube, I'm sorry to say it but you are entitled to absolutely nothing. Remember, this is a free platform. You get to speak to a global audience and impact their lives, but you've got to do that first before you deserve any reward.
Of course, it would be fantastic if YouTube was a completely level playing field, and everybody would enjoy the success that they deserve, depending on the content that they create.
But there will be some creators who have a viral moment with appalling content, while others slave away creating magnificent pieces of work that never get seen by the audience that deserves to see it.
Unfortunately, that is YouTube, but the moment you assume that you should get this or that or this creator shouldn't get this because your content is better is the moment where you've lost the mindset of YouTube and who should be rewarded for the content - it's your audience first and then you.
Mistake #2 Deleting Content from Your Channel
I've never been a fan of this and there are two principle reasons why:
First of all, you're damaging the metrics on your channel. If you delete a video it removes all of the views and all of the watch time. Which is especially important for people working towards monetization. Secondly, don't be embarrassed about the content that you've already got on your channel.
If you look at channels such as MrBeast, you can see the hundreds of terrible videos he put out on his channel before he was a success. So it's wonderful and fascinating to see the progress of a creator who went from nothing, and is now a YouTube megastar.
Mistake #3 Neglecting Your Audio Quality
I've said this before and I've stressed it heavily in thevidIQ academywhich of course you can check out, the first tech upgrade should be audio. You can get away with slightly dodgy visuals, or lighting that's not quite right, but when the audio is off, it is just so grating and annoying to the audience that it will make them switch off more than anything else.
I use a Rode Video Micro which cost me $60, and I still use it today and it significantly improves my video audio. You can read more aboutgetting the best audio quality for your videos here.
Mistake #4 Creating Off-Topic Content
This is an interesting one because it's often a symptom of a channel that either lacks focus or has too much self-indulgence. You’re creating a series of videos towards a particular audience, and then you decide to do something a little bit different. And that little bit different video takes off on your channel. And you're left with a decision whether or not to try and capitalize on that successful video, or continue to target your audience that you were trying to engage with in the first place.
Suddenly you go from becoming a travel channel to a beauty channel, or a financial channel to a laptop review channel. We came across an example where a channel was doing all of this business and financial advice and they randomly did a review on a cheap laptop from Costco. And this video got far more views than anything else on the channel. 7,000 views versus the average which might be a few hundred. What do you do in that situation?
Mistake #5 - Inconsistency
Ultimately this is all to do with focus. Finding your niche, going two inches wide a mile deep, on a particular topic, and building an audience through consistency. Which naturally leads us to the topic of inconsistency.
This can come in many different shapes and sizes. I think we've already talked about topic inconsistencies. But for a lot of creators, it's the inconsistency of video output. This is why it's good to have some sort of schedule in the back of your mind. Whether you stick to it religiously, by posting on the same day of the week, at the same time, or by telling your audience that you will publish a couple of several videos a week. But maybe not sticking to a strict schedule.
The truth is for a lot of creators, YouTube should take up a certain portion of your time, versus the rest of your life, but the lines often become blurred. Whether you're on a roll, or because you're super passionate about the videos that you're creating, you spend more and more time on YouTube, but there's only a certain amount of YouTube adrenaline that you can run off, before you get burnt out. Or life gets in the way and you need to take a break. So that's why I never recommend running at 100% YouTube capacity all the time.
If you do create five videos in a week, that's great. Maybe publish four of those and save one for later on when you do need to take a break.
Mistake #6 - Leaving YouTube for an Extended Break
We've seen this phenomenon occur several times with channels, when we've been auditing them on thevidIQ YouTube channel, every Tuesdays at 11 o'clock, Pacific Standard Time (sorry for the plug there.)
There are channels that have tens of thousands of subscribers. And the most recent videos are getting barely a couple of hundred views. And when we scroll through their list of videos, six, seven years ago the videos they were making were getting tens of thousands of views but unfortunately the channel took a significant break, and in that time the landscape of YouTube has changed radically.
This often happens with tutorial channels that were some of the first on the platform, providing answers to questions that hadn't been yet asked on YouTube. And there weren't enough channels providing answers. So even with questionable thumbnails, and content that wasn't brilliant, because the competition was so few and far between at that time, these channels were able to clean up. Now with far more sophisticated creators, who are really savvy with their production values, and enticing thumbnails, they're finding that they just can't compete anymore.
There is a really fine balancing act here for video creators and their channels. Absolutely if you need to take a break from the platform and do life stuff, I'm never going to tell a creator not to do that. But at the same time, YouTube, from a purely algorithmic point of view, hates procrastinators or channels that are not providing the content that they want to serve to an audience. And YouTube will go and find that content from another creator.
Granted we're talking about channels that haven't created anything for two, three, four years at this point. If you're going to have a break for a month or a week you're probably going to be okay. But, doing a hard stop on your channel, and then coming back in a few years time and expecting the same traction, I'm afraid that's just not going to be the case.
Mistake #7- Starting to Create Content too Late
And then there are those on the flip side of this YouTube mistake that are cursing about not starting early on YouTube. First of all, if you're beating yourself up because you think you've missed the boat because you want to start now but you had no intention of doing so years ago, don't beat yourself up. This is the same as blaming yourself for not buying Bitcoin when it was uber cheap, or right now not starting on the byte social media platform. Because who knows how that's going to turn out in the future.
It is how decisively you act on whether or not you want to start a YouTube channel, as opposed to when you first think about when you should've started a channel. I guess I will say this, if you've been watching YouTube videos for a year or two, and you've been thinking about starting a channel over that course of time, yes that is a mistake. If you want to start a travel channel, and you've been thinking about it for a couple of weeks, there's probably been 500 video creators or more who have started their travel vlog, and they're stealing your potential audience.
I would always encourage this, whether or not you think you're ready, start YouTube. Because you will learn a hell of a lot through experience. Right now, somebody is going to start their YouTube channel today, and by the end of the year, they're going to have a million subscribers. I can guarantee that.
Mistake #8 - ANYTHING To Do With Sub4Sub
Yeah you're right, this is probably the oldest YouTube mistake in the book. And I'm glad a couple of people recognized this, as an error in their ways. Watch this video for why:
Mistake #9 - Trying to Imitate Other Creators
When a viewer watches content on YouTube, and subscribes to a channel they usually do it because they have some sort of connection with the creator and it is content that they can't get anywhere else. So if your plan is to try and mimic an already well-established channel, the viewer is going to simply ask the question, why should I follow you? Why should I be interested in your content, if I can get it from somewhere else, with a more well-established channel, who probably does better content than you, if you're trying to imitate them?
Now I'm not going to sit here and point to you and just say be yourself, because as soon as you press a record button, for me at least, there's a different kind of pressure as if you're on stage. You can't help but change your identity in a certain way, because you feel as if you need to please an audience that's behind that camera.
It is so difficult for some people, and I count myself in this set, who can be natural in front of the camera. I don't know what it is, it's like putting on a different hat. Talking to an inanimate object feels so alien even now after all the videos that I've done. And I think that probably more comes through, in the editing that I do, I still feel a bit stiff on camera, but when I get into the editing suite, and I'm able to put that story together, that's where I feel my best creative personal real me qualities come through.
I think some of you will be able to pick up the internal struggle that I have in my head, whenever I talk in front of the camera. But I am so glad that I continue to do it every single day and challenge myself to be me on camera.
Mistake #10 - Trusting Just One Social Video Platform
Yeah yeah, all right. Nice little dig at Google and YouTube there, but I guess behind this mistake, there is a certain element of truth. Because if you put all of your eggs on one social media basket, all it takes is for YouTube to flick a switch, like they have done with the Adpocalypse, andCOPPA and the FTC, to see your channel, your audience, your potential business fall through the floor.
That is why in the long run it is important to diversify your skills, your reach, your brand so to speak. I know people hate this word, your presence on the internet can't just be restricted to one platform which has in effect total control over the destiny of your success.
Mistake #11 - Asking the Wrong Questions
I've chosen this one as an example of a mistake a lot of creators make when they simply don't listen to specific advice. Instead, they keep asking the same general questions to whoever is listening: How do I grow my channel? How do I get more subscribers? How do I get more views? Who on Earth can answer that question?
My guess is even if I wrote a 5000-word essay answer to those general questions, those people would ignore all of the advice and then two or three months down the line they would ask exactly the same question. How do I grow my channel?
Creators - do the research, do a bit of learning. Understand the analytics. Drill down into click-through rates, watch time, why some thumbnails work better than others, and then start to ask those specific questions of educators like us.
Because we love specific questions that we can really drill down into, and have discussions about. These broad questions are just an example of somebody, who I think again wants to get 1000 subscribers 4000 hours of watch time, and monetize their content without truly understanding the fundamentals of what being a content creator is.
And yes I know the irony is not lost on me that half the videos that we and other YouTube growth experts put out on YouTube are titled How To Get More Views and How To Get More Subscribers and How To Grow Your Channel. Those are the things that creators are searching for on YouTube, and we've got to get ourselves in front of those creators to try and educate them in a much more focused way.
Mistake #12 - Listening to the Wrong People
There are lots of people who come up with crazy zany ideas, some that are treading precariously along the terms of service of YouTube. My advice generally would be is if the strategy is going to get you quick views and subscribers, or hack your way to success, then it's probably advice you want to treat with caution.
If people are promoting organic ways to grow an audience over a period of time which never guarantee short term success, because you got to work hard as a video creator, then I think those are the type of people you want to listen to. Because they've gone through the journey themselves.
I always try to position myself, not as a YouTube growth expert who must be heard and followed to have success on their channel. There are huge gaps in my knowledge on YouTube. I find it difficult to advise on music channels. I don't know how vloggers can get in front of the camera, and be so personable and tell stories in the way that they do. But those channels fascinate me along with the entire YouTube platform.
And I am passionate about having the opportunity to spread my message and impact others on the YouTube platform which we see in the comments often. I and the rest of the vidIQ team, can share our experiences openly and honestly and you take value from it, then that's enough for me. And there's nothing wrong with listening to everybody's advice, testing it and seeing if it works because for different YouTube channels, and for different audiences, not everything works.
There are many routes on YouTube to that destination called success. And I like to think that here at vidIQ, what we do is put down road signs that help point you in the right direction. How you get there is entirely up to you and we will take a fraction of a percent of the success when you get there.
Mistake #13 - Not Allowing Yourself to Make Mistakes
Who said there's anything wrong with making mistakes? I almost feel as if a lot of people who want to start a YouTube channel, have to be of the mindset that their content has to be perfect to begin with. And they'll never start a channel because of that.
Evan Carmichael probably puts this best. I asked him what is the best tip for a person starting out on YouTube, and his simple advice was, "Expect to suck". But there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Because if you don't start somewhere, then you're never going to start, and everybody has to go through a YouTube journey.
As we've already said, some creators just have it, the X-Factor. Jennelle Eliana is a perfect example of a creator who was able to jump onto YouTube and just start making amazing content and that connected with a wide audience instantly.
But I certainly didn't enjoy that success when I first started. A couple a dozen people watched my first few videos, and it's taken me almost a decade to get to where I am today and that's taken 1500 videos plus. I make mistakes all of the time. It's taken me a good six hours to film this in front of camera, because I still continue to fluff up my lines. And no doubt in the future I will continue to make mistakes. I will make videos that I think are going to perform really well, and they'd never get off the ground. And you just have to experience those things as well on the YouTube platform.
I say this all the time and I'm going to say it again. The one thing that trumps all of the advice that you can get all of the technology you can purchase and anything else that comes from an external source is your experience. The more videos you create, the more videos you upload to YouTube, and the more you analyze the analytics and engage with your community, the better you will become as a video creator. And you will do it far faster if you are the one exposing yourself to all of the things that YouTube can bring into your creative landscape.
Start somewhere, look back on the content that you've made, and see where there are pain points, blockers, bottlenecks things you need to address. And aim to improve them by a couple of percent with every new video that you make. In the short term from video to video, you may not see the progress. But then when you look back on your videos from six months ago, you will see the radical changes and improvements that you've experienced and your audience will definitely connect with that. And those were some of your YouTube mistakes. Keep making them, embrace them, aim to do better next time.

Title: How Do YouTube Videos Actually Get Discovered by Viewers?

How Do YouTube Videos Actually Get Discovered by Viewers?
We always welcome a good sneak behind the curtains of YouTube. Luckily for us, a recent video fromCreator Insideris absolutely packed with information about how YouTube search and discovery works with regards to content.
The 19:22 minute video takes a deep dive into how YouTube discovers your videos and returns the results to viewers. You can watch the full video here, and read the show notes below:
How Viewers Discover Video on YouTube
YouTube’s goal for the homepage is to make it a “one-stop shop” where a viewer can find whatever they want to watch. Many users don’t have a goal in mind when they come in via the home page, so YouTube offers up a variety of results.

YouTube looks at two things to help them do that. One of those things is what it knows about the viewer and the history of what types of videos and channels they've watched before. Plus actions like do they watch long videos or short videos?
The other thing that can really influence the recommendations on the homepage is the performance of the video. When YouTube shows a video on the home page, it’s looking to see if viewers click on it, and how long do they watch, plus how well it is performing on average relative to other videos that it might also be showing to similar viewers.
So, often users come to the home page as casual viewers who are not quite sure what they want to watch. YouTube will offer a diverse set of options, such as videos from your past watch history, videos from channels you subscribe to, and videos that were popular with similar audiences. It presents a variety of content to make sure that people can find at least something that they're going to want to watch.
Watch Next and Suggested Videos
These options that feature on the watch page try to help the viewer find another video to watch next after the one they're currently watching. It’s different from the homepage because YouTube now has some sense of context for that viewer as they've already started to watch a video.
Unlike the content on the homepage, YouTube will now show videos that are related topically or from the same channel to try to help serve those viewers who want to continue watching the same sort of thing.
But also like the homepage, YouTube will also look at personalization and try to recommend videos that may not be exactly the same topic because one of the things that viewers have told YouTube through their behavior is that sometimes they want to change the channel.
For example, a viewer might be watching a music video or getting updated on their latest vlogger, but then once they watch that content, they want to try something different. And so YouTube again offers up a variety of videos so that no matter what type of user it is, whether they're looking to go deeper or switch contexts, that there're some results there for them.
So, on YouTube, the home page and watch next is how the majority of viewers on YouTube discover new videos.
What Happens When a Creator’s Content Performance Drops
The YouTube team confirmed that one of the most common questions they get asked is about why they see a decrease in the amount of viewership they're getting from either suggested viewers or from the home page.
They also confirmed that suggested traffic has been steadily going up over time, so there's no system-wide issue they have seen where traffic to suggested is dropping. However, what changes constantly about suggested videos are the rankings.
These rankings are updated constantly. __YouTube collects over 80 billion bits of information, or feedback from its audience every day, and it feeds that right back into the system so that it can know which videos are engaging and satisfying the viewers on each suggested list. __
When YouTube confirms the rankings are changing, it means that the viewer’s interests are changing over time, rather than any major changes in the algorithm. Also, rankings are different for every viewer, so YouTube is trying to optimize the results they serve up for each viewer to give them what they're going to want the most.
What Causes Changes in YouTube Traffic?
Creators should understand the reasons behind changes in traffic, and the three main reasons are supply, demand, and personalization:
Demandis basically how much interest is there out there in whatever a topic you're covering or whatever type of video you're making? And this can change significantly over time of course.
Supplyis how much of a specific type of content is being uploaded by other creators. In the video, YouTube confirmed that there are 500 hours of video being uploaded every minute, and the types of videos that are being uploaded is constantly changing as creators come up with new ideas or more creators start producing videos about a similar topic. So the competitive landscape is changing over time and that can influence how your video performs relative to other videos that the viewer might be interested in watching.
Personalization.YouTube rankings are different for every user because the platform is trying to give every user what they want and viewers' tastes change. You can't really optimize your videos for a traffic source or a surface, but you can for your audience.
So if you really want your viewers to continue watching your videos, one strategy is making really consistent content or even a series. That way, if those videos start being watched together, they're topically related and they attract the same type of viewer, so they're very likely going to come up next to each other in watch next.
YouTube Custom Thumbnails and Traffic
In the video, the team state that a pattern they are seeing around performance is around thumbnails. Right now the homepage thumbnails are much larger than the ones that appear in suggested. And that can actually lead to different performance depending on where the users are browsing from. The YouTube team has seen examples where a thumbnail works really well on the home page but is less effective in suggested, possibly because it's just harder to see what's going on.
That has a knock-on effect for the viewer because maybe now they don’t understand what the video is about so they scroll by in suggested. Whereas on the home page, when they see that big thumbnail they're more engaged.
One tip from the video is that YouTube encourages creators to look at their thumbnails at different sizes and see what it looks like in the suggested feed, especially on mobile. Do a little mockup and make sure that you've optimized so it'll work at both sizes. That's something you could do if you're not getting as much traffic from suggested.

Title: How to Get More YouTube Views by Understanding These New CRUCIAL Analytics

How to Get More YouTube Views by Understanding These New CRUCIAL Analytics
We are always talking about how you can get more views on your YouTube channel if you have a better understanding of yourimpressions and click-through rates. But access to that data hasn’t been possible to do away from a desktop - until now.
Understanding YouTube Analytics - Mobile Version!
The first thing you will need to do is to make sure your iOS or Android version of the Creator Studio app is fully up-to-date. To do this, go to either the Android Play Store or Apple App Store, search for ‘YouTube Studio’, and if it isn't up-to-date right now, you should get an option to update it from this screen.
Even the full desktop Creator Studio doesn't show you this side-by-side comparison, which can be useful to review as a snapshot of how impressions affect your click-through rate.

You can tap on each of the graphs to go into detail and the impressions will show you growth or decline over the last 28 days.
The dropdown filter allows you to refine your results to the last seven days but unfortunately not to the last 48 hours or 60 minutes so it isn't quite realtime, an advantage you do get through the desktop version.
YouTube Data insights: Video by Video
As well as channel impressions and click-through rates, you can view the same analytics on a video-by-video basis.
What Do These YouTube Analytics Mean?
Now for a quick explanation of these two analytics:
Impressionsare the number of times your thumbnail is seen on YouTube. You want as many impressions as possible because that's basically free advertising for your content.
The click-through rateis the number of times a person clicks on a thumbnail when it's seen. For example, if you get a hundred impressions and 10 people click on those thumbnails, that is a click-through rate of 10% and that would be considered very high and very good.
The quality of your thumbnails is what usually drives your click-through rate, so from our tutorials on how to make better thumbnails, we've got a playlist over here.
A lot of people have been getting very excited about these analytics finally coming to the mobile app, and you may be wondering why it's taken so long for that to happen when they've been available on desktop for over a year.
Well, to be honest, it's our fault. Well, I don't mean vidIQ's fault but the creator community at large. YouTube is currently having to maintain both the new Creator Studio and the Classic Creator Studio and until they can pull resources off of that Classic Studio, they can't put them into resources that will help them create all of these analytics for the mobile application.
So the quicker we can all get off Classic, which is happening very, very soon, the quicker YouTube can create more awesome tools for us on the desktop and mobile analytics for YouTube.

Title: How to Get More Views On YouTube From Your Channel Subscribers

How to Get More Views On YouTube From Your Channel Subscribers
Did you know that you can confirm the number of YouTube subscribers that actually click on your notifications? To find out how just do the following:
Bell notifications are the number of subscribers on your channel that have switched on all notifications.
The notification click-through rate is the crucial analytic we're interested in here. It represents the number of subscribers who actually clicked on the notification to watch the actual video. As YouTube states, typical CTR on notifications is between 0.5% and 2.5% percent.

Here's what I'd like you to do now. Go and find one of the most popular videos on your channel, and take a look at the notification click-through rate analytics.
YouTube CTR Analytics: Why That Metric Matters
Thenotification click-through ratemetric is an extension of data that YouTube rolled out to creators last year. You can access the data by going to Channel analytics, and then clicking on the Audience tab at the top of the screen, and scrolling down to Subscriber bell notifications.
As you might expect, we did a full tutorial on that data at the time, so you can check it out here:
As a suggestion to YouTube, what I'd love to see here is the notification click-through rate for your entire channel over the last 28 days. Oh, and I'd also like to add it as a metric in the advance analytics for individual videos too, thank you very much.
Now, for me, these analytics have been somewhat of an eye-opener. We currently have 475,000 subscribers, and over 35,000 of those clicked on the notification bell, and yet that only generates 500 views. Doesn't really seem worth it, does it?
However, as with all analytics, you have to put it into the context of your channel as a whole.
Those first 500 views are valuable for the first couple of hours of a video's launch, to get that velocity on your content. However, through our experience with the vidIQ channel, an educational channel, we know that we're going to get the majority of our views, over the long term, from browse and search.
For other channels where the storytelling and the personality is far more important to the channel itself, then you would expect a higher click-through rate on notifications. But remember, it's still, at a benchmark level, relatively low at 2.5%.
So, ake these analytics from a few videos, and benchmark them. Let's say your average notification click-through rate is 1%, then aim to improve that to 1.2%, or 1.4% over the next three to six months.

How to Create a YouTube Channel: 10 More Amazing Tips
If you're reading this blog post then it's a pretty good bet that you're ready to make the leap and start the YouTube channel you've been promising yourself to. While it's a cliche, there really is never a better time to do so than right now. We're making it easy for you with the tips and tricks all the successful YouTubers use.
Check out our first blog post 'How to Start a YouTube Channel: 10 Brilliant Tips', download ourfree YouTube tool, and don't forget to subscribe to ourYouTube channelso you get all the help you'll need on this exciting journey!
How to Create Your YouTube Channel: 10 Amazing Tips
Check out all 20 tips in the following video:

Tip #1 Write a full ‘About’ section for your YouTube channel
First of all it addresses what the viewer is going to get from your channel. Introduce who you are a little bit, and then reinforce what the viewer is going to get with even more good stuff in another paragraph. YouTube does search these channel descriptions, so it also helps with your SEO.
Tip #2 Invest in lighting equipment
If you're going to be filming outside most of the time, brilliant, you've got all the natural light in the world. However, if you're filming indoors, you probably want to invest in some proper studio lighting, because it will have a massive impact on the quality of your videos. Great lighting can really help with your videos, much more than say a new camera, at least in my opinion.
Tip #3 Go all-in with YouTube Custom Thumbnails
Now for a whistle-stop tour of some thumbnail tips and tricks:
You are right in that we barely scratch the surface here, so check out our fullYouTube playlist on custom thumbnails here, and also check out the thumbnail courses in thevidIQ Academy.
Tip #4 Become a KILLER editor
Don't just record footage, make sure to edit it as well. It may often be the case that you have half of your footage on the cutting room floor that you never use, and that's fine, because you only want the best and tightest footage to put to an audience. You can also use editing to shave off those little pauses at the beginning, in the middle, the end of your talking.
And, also think about pattern interrupts. Have you noticed something different about this part of the video? It's because I'm not using any pattern interrupts. I'm just talking, and it's probably getting a little bit boring for you now, because I'm not doing any of the sound effects, and music's not playing. The camera's not changing, and shifting angles a little bit, and... You see, I've paused here, and I've got it wrong, and I'm not going to edit this out, I'm going to keep it in, because that's where you'd want to edit your wrong stuff out.
Anyway, where was I? Pattern interrupt. It allows you to keep the viewer engaged by changing something in the scene, every five to 10 seconds. Try that the next time you're editing your videos, and instead of a minute-long worth of rambly stuff, you'll get a clean 15-second footage that your audience will enjoy a lot longer.
Tip #5 Remember to be you!
This is something I have to constantly remind myself because it's so easy to change persona when you press a record button. Remember to be you. There's only one of you in the entire world unless you have an identical twin. Your audience wants to see something different, something that they can't get anywhere else, and they can only get that from you if you are uniquely you.
If you try to imitate somebody else, it won't feel authentic, and your audience will see right through it. When you start to relax and be you on camera, as hard as that can sound to begin with, when you press record, your audience will start to react to you.
Now, it could be that the audience loves you, or the audience hates you. The important thing is, is that they feel something about you. That's what you want from your audience. And you can ignore all of the people who hate you. You don't need to care about them. You need to put all of your love into those who love you back. Embrace your audience.
But, the moment you start to worry about the judgment of your audience, that's when you start to change on camera, and you don't be you anymore. All of the mannerisms, the way you talk, the quirks that you have, embrace them, and share them on YouTube because if you don't, that's going to leave a mark on your ego.
Tip #6 YouTube Keyword Research FTW
All right, time to get into some keyword research basics. Get into the head of what your typical target audience viewer is likely to search for on YouTube, and create content, and titles, and metadata around those search terms.
The YouTube Search bar itself is a super powerful tool because it auto predicts what people are searching for, depending on the time of year. For example, as I record this at the end of December if I type in just the word star, it brings me back all of the results for 'Star Wars Episode 9: Rise of Skywalker', because that is trending right now. Use it on your own topic, to find out what people are searching for, and again make content around those subjects.
Use theVidIQ toolsto find out what keywords have potential on YouTube, those being with high search volume, but low competition. And although tags are no longer important, it's still interesting to look at the metadata that other creators are using, because it represents the detail and level of research that goes into their content. I will still argue that it's much better to give YouTube as much information about your video as possible, rather than none at all. It may give you the marginal edge, versus other videos who are competing with you, who are a similar size.
And once again, that is a fraction of a percentage of the knowledge that we have about keyword research. We have even more information in an hour-plus course on thevidIQ Academy, along with this video and this post onkeyword research for YouTube:
Tip #7 Become part of the YouTube community
When you start to make videos on a particular topic, you become part of that YouTube community. Make sure to join it. And by that I mean watch other peoples' content, and post comments, add to the discussion.
People will start to recognize your name in the comments, and by adding value, not just trying to spam your own stuff, people will be interested in you and come to watch your content. And who knows, the video creator themselves might recognize you after a while, and you could potentially do a collaboration.
Try not to think of other video creators in your space as competition, but as collaborators. The nature of video creating on YouTube, forces it into a singular, sometimes lonely experience, and there are millions of video creators who do this, but they're all working towards the same goal, to make an impact on a shared audience. Why not share the creating experience as well? You get to share your audience with somebody else's audience, and vice versa.
Just remember this at the forefront of your communication with others. It's all about the value that you can add, not what you can take out of it. That comes afterwards, and it becomes a far greater reward when you achieve this.
Tip #8 Maximize Your YouTube Description
Got some quick YouTube description tips for you now:
Tip #9 Set realistic goals and be patient
If you're this deep into the video, you've probably got a lot of this in abundance, but it does bear repeating because YouTube can be a tough game.
To succeed as a video creator, you are going to need determination and patience. You may take all the advice from many sources, all good, put it into practice, and then you may see very little in return for a very long time. You could be 200 videos, and six months into this, and wonder why am I not gaining views and subscribers? And then, all of a sudden, it happens overnight, and you have a viral moment for your channel.
For a lot of creators on YouTube, overnight success takes weeks, months, sometimes even years. Just remember this, if you're putting in the hard work, and the analytics are telling you good things, as well as your audience, eventually, YouTube will stop ignoring you, and start to distribute your content to more people, but it does sometimes take a little longer than what you might think.
With that in mind, I want you to set goals that are achievable in the next month to three months. Rather than setting your first goal to monetize your content, try and go for something more obtainable, like 50 subscribers, 100 subscribers, 10,000 views. Those sort of step by step targets that you can celebrate on an incremental level until you reach those big goals.
If your first goal is to monetize your content on YouTube, again you're thinking about how you can extract as much as possible from YouTube, as opposed to providing as much value to your audience as possible.
Tip #10 Don’t say goodbye too soon
“And that's it”, “thanks for watching,” “hope you enjoyed this video.” All words and phrases you should never use at the end of a video. The moment a viewer can sniff that you're trying to wrap up a video, using trigger words such as that, they will immediately switch off.
You should be keeping the viewer engaged right up to the moment the video ends. Yes, you can have calls to action, to ask people to subscribe to your videos, etc, but never tell the viewer that it's basically time to switch over.

Recreating YouTube Success by Understanding Analytics: TubeTalk Episode 158
Many YouTubers have had that one successful video that has outperformed all others, and a deep-dive into your analytics can uncover the secrets to your most-viewed content. In this episode of TubeTalk, the YouTuber podcast, we show you what metrics to look out for, what you should be focusing on, and how you can replicate success across your channel.
We’re joined by Dane Golden, CEO ofHEY.com, and he’s all about helping businesses get more value from their video marketing efforts. Dane is the founder of the TubeTalk podcast, and he's also been a vidIQ user since Day 1. He’s also a proudvidIQ affiliate! Click on the link above or download the TubeTalk podcast from the following:
If you have followed all the best practices for creating a great video, like giving it a great title and a compelling thumbnail, it should perform as well as any other you have uploaded. But we all know that’s not the case - some videos underperform and it pays to understand exactly why. In this podcast we take a look at:

Understanding Audience Retention for YouTube Success
Just one of the topics covered in this TubeTalk podcast is Audience Retention. Dane confirms that a good way to look at the audience retention metric is to ask “how fast do people want to leave this video?" because in many videos it's very fast! He divides audience retention into three parts:
The intro and hook:How well does your intro and hook correspond with what you're doing in the thumbnail and title? If there is a disconnect between what you’ve promised and what you actually deliver your audience retention can drop very fast. For instance, if your thumbnail and title promises a video about ice cream but you actually focus on pizza your audience is not going to stick around (or come back).
The middle part:This really is the bulk of the video where you should be engaging your viewers after the initial premise, keeping them interested and continuing to add value.
The end part (including the endscreen):Did you convince your viewers to stay to the very end? Getting them to click on your end screen can really improve not just the ranking of that video, but the channel overall. You want to keep them watching as long as possible, and convince them to convince them to click and watch another video. If you can get them to watch to the end and get them to watch your next video, that's a very powerful signal forYouTube Watch Time.
Looking at each of these sections independently can really help you understand how your content appeals to your audience. A lot of creators focused on the intro and the hook, but should take into consideration all three parts.
If you're a marketer and want to out more about how to promote your business on YouTube using high value, low cost, helpful how-to videos, you can watch Dane and HEY.comon YouTube. Also he interviews the top video marketing experts on the "Video Marketing Value Podcast." And he's huge on LinkedIn, sofollow him there as well.

Title: YouTube Watch Time: The Secret Sauce to More YouTube Views and Subscribers

YouTube Watch Time: The Secret Sauce to More YouTube Views and Subscribers
Pay attention because this tip is super important. Why? Because YouTube wants you to get as much Watch Time as possible in every single video that you make. For those who've never heard this term before, Watch Time is generally considered the most important metric on YouTube. Basically it is the physical number of minutes and hours your content is watched for by people on YouTube. But why is Watch Time more important than views?
Watch Time: Good for YouTube, Good for Video Creators
Let's take a look at it from this perspective. Views represent clicks, or visits, but they don't tell you for how long somebody is on the YouTube platform or on the mobile app. The more Watch Time YouTube has from its audience, the more ads they can sell to the audience, making more money for YouTube, and more money for the video creator. So it stands to reason that the more Watch Time you can create from your videos, the more YouTube is going to reward you, and share your content with more people. Win win win.
But also bear in mind that you don't have to monetize your content to benefit from this. The search and discovery engine is separate from the monetization engine. Let's do a simple example here. You've got a video with 1,000 views, with an average view duration of one minute. That gives you 1,000 minutes of Watch Time in total. But you've also got a video with 500 views, with five minutes of Watch Time, which gives you a total of 2,500 minutes of Watch Time. Which do you think has the better chance of doing well on YouTube in the long run? Yeah, it's probably video B.

YouTube have stated that when it comes to Watch Time, audience retention is hugely important, but there are a lot of ways to get more Watch Time, and that's what we're gonna explore right now.
Using YouTube Analytics to Confirm Watch Time Stats
Let's look at the numbers first. If you haven't already seen ourbeginner's guide to YouTube analytics, I recommend you watch that video at some point to help with navigating around these screens more confidently.
With that being said, on the Creator Studio dashboard, click on ‘Analytics’, and then at the top of the graphs, click on the ‘Interest Viewers’ tab. You should now see an average view duration box and if you click on this, it will show you a graph of on average how long your videos are watched for. This is useful from a channel perspective, and as we've already said, more is better.
But this graph doesn't take into account how long each individual video is. So to improve Watch Time, you really want to start by scrutinizing every single second of a single video. To do this, click on the ‘Videos’ link to the left, which lists all of your videos. Then choose a video you want to analyze. Click now on the analytics section, and on the first screen here, you should see this audience retention box.
Now, you can make a video an hour long if you want to, but if nobody's watching it after a single minute, that's going to send some pretty negative signals to YouTube. Audience retention is all about keeping that viewer interested throughout the entirety of your video. Keeping them informed, interested, intrigued, and entertained. And you want to try and get that audience retention to as close to 100% as possible. Generally speaking, that's very difficult to do. So a general benchmark is somewhere around about 50%. And this box will tell you all that, the total length of the video, and the average view duration converted into a percentage.
To really drill down into this data, you can click on the ‘See More’ button, and then watch the video to see where there are peaks and dips in your content. There's always loads of useful stuff you can glean from audience retention graphs, like why Audience increase or decreased at a certain point in the video.
The Importance of Short Video Intros
Let's talk about how important video intros are. You are always going to have a sharp drop off in viewership as soon as the video starts. For some viewers, the content is just not going to click, and they will turn off instantly. And then there's gonna be another group of viewers who may stick around more maybe 15 or 30 seconds to try and determine whether this video delivers in some way from the thumbnail and the title. That's why there needs to be some sort of hook or payoff. A way to entice a viewer to invest a few more minutes into the video, and hopefully keep them engaged for the entirety of the video. You can look back at pretty much any video on vidIQ, and you'll see me trying to entertain, inform, or intrigue you in those first 15 seconds before you see the vidIQ splash screen. That is my attempt to get you to watch longer, and I think it works, generally speaking.
On educational videos, creators will give you the final result at the beginning of the video, and then the rest of the video is about how to get there. For compilations or stories, there may be an epic part of the video that's used at the very beginning intro, and you don't actually see that part until maybe four or five minutes into the actual video. It's kind of like teasing a story before you watch the beginning of it. So if you've not tried this before, experiment with a dedicated intro to your video, and try to keep it to 15 seconds or less. Oh, and your branded intro or bumper should be no longer than five seconds.
How to Keep the YouTube Viewer’s Attention with Pattern Interrupts
Because as you well know, the average audience attention span of a YouTube viewer can be pretty short. So how do you fix that? You do something called pattern interrupt. A pattern interrupt is a change of pace, tone, and style - think of pattern interrupts as attention reset buttons. You still know what the videos about, but there's something new to look at on the screen
I try to have a pattern interrupt at least once every ten seconds, but other video creators do pattern interrupts every two or three seconds. Now, there is one huge drawback to the video creator when you use pattern interrupts, and that's editing. It adds hours to the process. So try not to go overboard, and start to watch video creators who operate in your space on YouTube with a critical eye to see if they adopt pattern interrupt strategies, and how often they do it. You should start to notice that the best video creators in your space adopt a certain style and tone through pattern interrupts that you should be at least aware of if you're not trying to follow in some way. Also, consider using B-roll in your video to keep the YouTube viewer watching and entertained. And if you’re going to try and cover many topics in a single video, at least tell the viewer in the title or the video intro, or do another dedicated video on that topic. Stay focused, edit ruthlessly.
Don’t Create Long Videos for the Sake of it
The most important currency on YouTube is time. You want as much Watch Time as possible, but your viewer wants to spend their time on YouTube as efficiently as possible. Just because YouTube states that Watch Time is one of its most important ranking factors, doesn't mean you should make longer videos to get more Watch Time. You're pandering too much to an algorithm, and doing a disservice to your audience.

Title: Your Complete YouTube Channel Audit Guide with vidIQ

Your Complete YouTube Channel Audit Guide with vidIQ
If you've never clicked on the vidIQ Channel Audit button, now is the time.
It is our most power tool, we've just upgraded it, so this is your complete beginner's guide on how to use it.
Note: In order to follow along you’ll need tosign up for a vidIQ account. Don’t worry, we offer a Free version of the tool if you’re not quite ready to access our premium features.

5 sections of Channel Audit
The Channel Audit tool is divided into five sections. Starting at the top you have an instant snapshot of the health of your channel.
Second is the Content to Double Down On section, which includes eight different metrics that track your best videos in each of these categories.
On the top-right hand-side are videos from competitor channels.
On the lower-right-hand side is the traffic being sent your way from other channels’ videos (Top Suggested). These are you cluster channels.
So whether you want to know which videos have the most watchtime, the most views, the highest audience retention or gained the most subscribers, the Content to Double Down On section is what you want to review to help you decide on what content to produce next.
We also include which search terms are driving the most traffic to your channel, as well as the performance of your endscreens and interactive cards.
These often forgotten about YouTube tools can really help with engagement and ensure your audience to directed to more of your content.
As well as showing you what you're doing right you also need to know what needs more work which is why we've included the Content That Could Use Work section.
This section shows your videos with the lowest watchtime, likes ratio, audience retention, views and which videos are actually causing your subscribers to leave your channel.
The final two sections are all about improving the metadata — that's tags, titles and descriptions — of your videos.
The Average Metrics and Items to Improve Upon sections highlight where you might have missed opportunities such as adding video cards, endscreens as well as adding videos to playlists.
Interactive Channel Audit features
The channel audit includes many interactive features to give you even deeper insights and analytics.
Mouse over the channel snapshot metrics for more details such as views this month versus views last month.
Click “View More” in each category to see a comprehensive list of all the videos ranked using that specific metric, as well as if they rank highly in other categories. Those videos which rank for multiple categories could be considered your premium performers.
Click on the video panels within each category to instantly view the relevant metrics for that video in the classic YouTube Creator Studio analytics.
Back on the audit screen, for both the Competitors and Top Suggested categories, click on any of the panels to link directly to that video's watch page.
And in the top-right-hand corner of the channel audit screen, change the time frame to see your channels performance over the past 30, 60 and 90 days. (Note: This feature is only available with vidIQ Boost.)
You can even tick the “Limit to videos in timeframe” box to audit only videos published within the selected timeframe with all other vide0s and their metrics filtered out.
Dive deeper into all of the data points you find within top search terms, interactive cards and endscreens by clicking on each one to take you back to the classic YouTube creator studio for more in-depth analysis.
Finally, the bottom two sections are all about taking action now on your existing content. Let's take title length as an example.
vidIQ suggests our average title length is good, but does that apply to all titles? Clicking on the panel will list all videos published in the selected timeframe and show us whether each title hits the sweet spot. (Note: If you’re a Free vidIQ user, you’ll see only 2 results on these screens.)
Now if we take endscreens as another example, we’ll discover we’re missing endscreens on one video.
Clicking the edit icon to the right takes us directly to the endscreen tool for that video in YouTube, allowing us to fix the issue instantly!
Tell us what you think!
Channel Audit V2 as we are affectionately calling it is one of our biggest upgrades ever, which is why we want your help.
Do make sure to click “What do you think” at the top and share your thoughts on what you like, what you don't like and what you want to see next. Or give us a shout onTwitter.
As a side note you can tick the “Include Screenshot” box to download a full-screen image of your channel audit.

Title: Did Burger King Exploit Casey Neistat or did Casey Neistat Exploit Burger King?

Did Burger King Exploit Casey Neistat or did Casey Neistat Exploit Burger King?
Last week on January 23rd 2019 the Burger King social media team started liking influencer Tweets from 2009 and 2010. They liked three of Casey's tweets and here was his response.

At the time of this Tweet he did not know that this was a trick Burger King was using to get influencers to give them free publicity and this single Tweet got over 13,000 likes. The truth was Burger King was using many influencers for a launch campaign. They are reintroducing funnel cake fries.


Shortly after that the truth came out from an article from Complex titled "the truth on why Burger King was liking your old tweets". Here is Casey's response video where he claims that Burger King Exploited him.
Our Question is Who Exploited Who?
On one hand you could say that Burger King used shady practices to get buzz about a new product launch. But on the other Casey took full advantage of this situation and tells Burger King to work with him for charity.
Infact they responded and seem to have agreed to his terms

Creativity For The Win!
No matter your opinion on the matter this all happened from a brilliant social media team. We are not saying what they did was the right thing but it did gain attention and start something bigger. For example we are blogging about Burger King and Casey on a Tuesday.

Title: How to Get More Views and Subscribers with YouTube Analytics

How to Get More Views and Subscribers with YouTube Analytics
Curious which analytics you should be focusing on in the coming months to help grow your channel? Look no further — here are the top 5 analytics to get you more views and subscribers on YouTube in 2019.
Note: In order to follow along you’ll need to access the new YouTube Studio beta. If you’re still on Creator Studio Classic, you'll see a big blue “YOUTUBE STUDIO BETA” link in the top-left-hand corner. Click there and you'll instantly see a radically different analytics page.
1. Click-through rate
The first analytic we want to look at is click-through rate. Put simply, your click-through rate is the number of times somebody clicks on one of your thumbnails or titles from the total number of times it's been seen.

So if three people see your video and one of them chooses to watch it, that’s a click-through rate essentially of 33.3%.
In the YouTube Studio beta, you can see the impressions and click-through rates for the past 28 days by simply navigating to “Analytics” from the dashboard and then clicking on “Reviewers.”
You can also go to different cards in the YouTube analytics and look at a breakdown of click-through rates. So if I click on Top Videos, for example, it will list the click-through rate for individual videos as well.
Now if you’re wondering why you should care about your click-through rate, here are three key reasons:
Every single analytic from your YouTube channel trickles down from click-through rate. People have to actually click on your thumbnail to watch your content before you can gain traction with other analytics such as watchtime, subscribers, comments, and all the rest of that good stuff.
Viewers judge videos by their thumbnails just as readers judge books by their covers, so it's really important to have a good first impression. Your click-through rate represents intrigue — of topic, thumbnail or title. For example, recently we covered the subscriber rate of PewDiePie vs. T-Series. Because it was a very intriguing topic at the time, and we used very targeted keywords and colorful thumbnails, our click-through rate for that particular topic went through the roof.
An important to remember about click-through rate is it’s not an exact science. I often hear people say between 2% and 10% is a “good” click-through rate, but I think it’s better to focus simply on improving your click-through rate.
Click-through rates vary from video topic to video topic, and it's heavily influenced by where you are simply in the order of suggested videos and search pages. If you're at the top of a search page, you can have a terrible thumbnail but a high click-through rate simply because of the prime real estate.
Don't get too caught up comparing your click-through rate versus somebody else's. Look at your click-through rate, and aim to improve it one or two percentage points over 2019 — that will bring in a significant number of views.
2. Audience retention
Channel analytics can give you some insight into average view duration, but a more accurate approach is look at audience retention on individual videos.
To do this, click “Videos” along the left-hand nav. Click on the video that you want to investigate and you’ll see audience retention.
Mouse over the graph and you'll see the audience retention at a specific point in the video, or click on a point and then press play. Doing so will allow you to see the audience retention alongside the video in real-time, giving you clues to investigate drops and spikes in retention.
And if you’re thinking that watchtime is the ultimate analytic king on YouTube and not audience retention, consider that YouTube tends to favor content with more than 50% audience retention. So whether your videos are two minutes long, four minutes long or six minutes long, aim first to make your content better to improve audience retention, and then start to think about making longer videos if that's what you want to do with your content to get more watchtime.
3. Recommended Content
Each individual video has likes and dislikes, andvidIQhas a funky little tool that turns these metrics into a Likes to Dislikes Ratio.
But what if you want this for your entire channel?
Well they do in the form of YouTube recommended content. When viewers watch your content and enjoy it, they generally watch for longer, and YouTube loves this.
When YouTube loves your content, they want to share it with more people. That means putting it on the homepage, Browse Features and the suggested videos on watch pages — and the more you can push this line into the orange, the more YouTube is doing all the hard work for you.
Rather than people having to search to find your content or find it through the subscription feeds, they're finding it in random places because YouTube wants to share your content with a wider audience.
So how do you manipulate this magic formula to get it to work for you? Engaging thumbnails, intriguing titles — which are then clicked onto — increased watchtime on your content and, as we mentioned, getting above 50% with your audience retention.
For example, take a look at vidIQ’s September analytics below. Notice the 2.5 million impressions, 27.8% of which came from YouTube recommending our content.
Now take a look at vidIQ’s analytics for October when the T-Series vs. PewDiePie subscriber rates was in full flow.
Look at the radical change here: 17 million impressions, and YouTube was recommending our content way more, especially on homepages.
We were feeding YouTube exactly what they wanted and so they responded by sharing it with a much wider audience.
4. Subscribers gained
I may be missing something here in the new analytics dashboard, but I can't find a good way to show subscribers gained from videos, so we're going old school here.
Navigate to Creator Studio Classic, click on “Subscribers” and then “YouTube watch page”. This will show you all the videos that are converting viewers into subscribers.
Since there is no analytic that tracks trust, tracking subscribers gained is the next best thing. Think about it, why else would someone subscribe to your channel unless they trust you — trust you to entertain, educate or emotionally impact you.
People who subscribe to your channel from a video watch page usually do it because they’ve experienced a light bulb moment — something that instinctively and instantly drives them to click that button.
InvidIQyou can look at subs gained a lot quicker than through YouTube analytics through the subs gained column on our channel audit.
If you click on “View More”, you can see all of the videos that are driving viewers to turn into subscribers. It's almost like your trust column.
We also have click-through rate, audience retention, YouTube recommended content, and subscribers gained.
5. Audience engagement
We said earlier that gaining subscribers through your videos is like building trust with your audience. Gaining comments, likes and dislikes through your videos is building engagement — another really important facet of YouTube.
Strictly speaking, YouTube doesn't track engagement rate, but the vidIQ channel audit tool does. Use it to see which videos are generating conversation or whether they're polarizing in terms of how many people react to it with likes versus dislikes.
Astonishingly here, we have one video with 68% engagement rate, but that's because we were having a little bit of fun with YouTube premieres.
In terms of engagement rates, we also want to look at the finer points as well. If we scroll down the channel audit page, we can look at how often the end screens are clicked on — you know, those boxes right at the end of videos.
As a final thought on engagement, don’t forget the Community tab if you have access to it.
Use it to ask your audience what video you should make next, collect general feedback or start a conversation. You might be surprised by the response. In fact, we’ve found that some of our posts are getting more feedback from the videos themselves.
Our call to action
All of these analytics are super important, but if you don’t actually do something with them then you’re missing the point. Remember: Doing the same thing over and expecting different results is a sign of insanity.
Our challenge to you is simple: Act on the data you’re getting from YouTube andvidIQ, share your experiments with us onTwitterand good luck in growing your channel in 2019!

Title: How to Get More Views and Subscribers FAST on YouTube

How to Get More Views and Subscribers FAST on YouTube
To kick off 2019, we've got 10 practical resolutions to help you get more views, more subscribers and ultimately grow your channel.
Let's do this!
1. Get that channel banner sorted
The YouTube channel banner is essentially an advertising billboard for your channel. Ensure it demonstrates to visitors:

What you do on your channel Why you do it Why you’re the person to do it (authority and passion)
See what we mean in the example below:
Your YouTube channel banner should be consistent with the branding, colour and design of the video thumbnails. And don’t forget to make sure it’s mobile friendly, so the edges don’t get cut off.
2. Write a compelling channel description
The channel description in the YouTube About section is what visitors will read when they search and find your channel. Think about writing your channel description as if you were writing a tweet of 140 characters — people have very short attention spans, so it should be clear and concise.
Keep in mind, too, that when people first visit your channel, chances are they’re more interested in what’s in it for them. Avoid self-indulgent biographies and instead focus on what your channel can do for your audience. A simple way to check yourself is to search how many times “you” or “your” appears in the channel description. Take a peek at the example below from vidIQ’s About page:
Bonus points for applying the same principles to your video descriptions, too. Your audience can always read the first couple of lines, so make them count.
3. Develop and apply consistent design to everything
A proper style guide will ensure consistency across your entire channel and all the elements within it. Define your fonts, colors, logos and brand images, and keep them all in one place to apply to your channel art, thumbnails, video intros and even the lower thirds, like this one:
4. Make your channel welcoming to visitors
Think of your channel as the front room of your home or your place of business and you as the gracious host.
An effective way to create a welcoming channel to new visitors is to include a dedicated channel trailer or use a high-converting video as your channel trailer, sure to increase your subscriber count.
You should also consider creating a playlist that shows off your best content and use it to introduce your audience to your channel. Putting the most recent uploads playlist near the top will let your visitors know your channel is still active and posting on a consistent basis.
5. Engage your audience as much as possible
One of the mistakes many video creators make is to ask questions at the end of a video. By that time you've lost a significant portion of your audience — just take a look at your audience retention to see for yourself.
Asking your visitors a question at the beginning, the middle and the end of a video — maybe even including a voting poll as well — really will help keep your audience engaged along with the content.
6. Add an actionable branding watermark
On the bottom right corner of your video is your branding watermark, and it's a call to action for viewers to subscribe to your channel. In order for it to achieve its objective, it should say exactly what it does.
Rather than using your channel logo, instead use something that invites viewers to subscribe to your channel.
In the example above from the vidIQ channel, you’ll see a very simple ‘SUBSCRIBE’ button. Once we switched to this graphic, our click rate on this button increased more than 500% almost instantly, which you can see in the graph below.
Download the subscribe graphic here, or for more information on how to create your own and set it up on YouTube watch our video,How to Add a YouTube Subscribe Button that Gets Results in 2018!
7. Reference your own related YouTube content
Did you notice what we did in that last resolution? We referenced our own related content to encourage the audience to stick around in the vidIQ YouTube universe.
Always plug your own content and directly reference it on screen. And remember, the more stupidly overenthusiastic, the better.
8. Respond to every single comment
You work is not finished when you press publish. If your audience is taking the time to comment on your videos, respect their time and energy by replying to every single one.
If you get too many comments, block off an hour a day in your calendar for responding. You could even pin the best comments to your videos, or pin your own comments to continue the conversation in the comments section, like we’ve done in the example below.
If replying to every comment feels overwhelming, remind yourself that the comments section is where connections begin, which could evolve into collaborations, brand deals, friendships and more.
9. Use the YouTube Community tab
The YouTube Community tab is available to all channels with over 1,000 subscribers and can be a huge engagement opportunity if you know how to use it right. In fact, you’ll often find that a well-crafted question or voting poll gets as much engagement, if not more, than your videos.
For more information on how to use it, check out our dedicated video,How To Build a YouTube Audience Through The Community Tab!
10. Scrap the canned goodbyes
This last resolution sounds really easy, but believe me, when you're programmed to say canned phrases like “That’s it for this one,” or “Hope you enjoyed the video,” or “Thanks for watching,” at the end of every single video, it can be a hard habit to drop.
As soon as you say things like that, the audience knows that the content has effectively finished and they leave the video in droves. Take a peek at your audience retention — you’ll likely see an immediate drop.
For your next video, I want to challenge you to scrap the canned phrases and instead promote related content or just do a hard finish.
What’s your number one YouTube resolution for 2019? Let us know onTwitter!

Title: How to Get More YouTube Views? Passion and Authority

How to Get More YouTube Views? Passion and Authority
Can you guess what question we get asked the most? It’s pretty obvious: How do I get more views on YouTube?
The answer, however, is far from obvious; unless you break it down into a hundred jigsaw pieces. And what jigsaw pieces do you look for first? The corners of course.
So let’s look at four crucial pieces of the YouTube puzzle What Do YOU Love to Talk About? YouTube knows what its audience wants, so you need to think like YouTube. Let’s say your passion is videogames. Be specific. If you love Fortnite or Call of Duty or Fifa 18, make sure to focus on that topic.

The more passionate you are about something, the more you know about it and the more confident you will be creating and sharing content about it.
Passion is an invisible vibe, energy and presence that your audience can always see.
Who Should Be Watching and Why? Don’t stop at just your favourite game, film, beauty product or superhero either. Dive deeper. Popular topics attract thousands of video creators, so you need to provide the audience with something they can’t get anywhere else.
Ask yourself this question: who should be watching and why? If you can’t answer that question then your audience won’t understand or (worst still) won’t care about your content. If someone else can answer those two questions better that’s where the audience will go.
This is your target audience and your value proposition and you should be able to sum it up in a sentence. For example: Helping Video Creators Get More Views In Less Time.
Always Think About Your Niche
A ‘niche’ is an interest that appeals to a small, specialized section of the audience. Let’s say you buy the latest iPhone and you want to do a general video review on it. OK great, but the chances are there is a tech channel with millions of subscribers that has more resources to produce something in a shorter time frame to a wider audience.
But is that massive tech channel interested in EVERY aspect of the iPhone? Probably not, they will have another big phone release to worry about. But you? You could have a special interest in how the camera works or the best apps for productivity or how to record the screen. The chances are, if you are interested in something, there will be an audience out there who is also interested in the same thing.
This is your niche. While there may be millions of people interested in an iPhone, there may only be a few thousand interested in recording the iPhone screen, yet still passionate enough about it to create guides and tutorials that spread a message of value better than anyone else.
Dominate Your Niche and Become the Authority With passion, a target audience, a value proposition and a niche you know better than anyone else, you will start to build an audience.
Usually, there comes a point where one video outperforms everything else you’ve published before: 2x, 5x, 10x, it becomes your viral moment.
When this happens, go all in on follow up content. YouTube is telling you: you have something of value and we want to share it with more people. Your stock rising, your authority is gaining momentum, we ALL want to see more from you about something you are passionate about and can trust you with.
Try this: search for ‘Record iPhone Screen’ and you may see a very familiar vidIQ face appearing over and over again. Who knew such a niche could bring in so many views?
Final Thought
Channel success stories usually start with a niche that builds trust between the YouTuber and their audience. They then take that audience on a journey through more topics that stretch that authority into new, larger audiences.
Try this: do a YouTube search for ‘How Big Is’. This search term is dominated by a YouTuber called ColdFusion. The channel was already successful with tech videos that got 10,000s views. The ‘How Big Is’ video brought in millions of views and now ColdFusion is the authority on the phrase.
