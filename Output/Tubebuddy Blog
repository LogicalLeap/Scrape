The New YouTube Subscribe Button is Awesome
YouTube has viewer’s and creator’s best interests at heart and YouTube’s new subscribe button behavior is the latest example.
The new YouTube Subscribe button is awesome. It’s fun. It’s inviting. It speaks to both viewers and content creators alike.
Just as YouTube should.
If you take nothing else away from this post, take this: as a creator, you have to ask viewers to subscribe to your channel in your videos.
Simply asking viewers to subscribe has made all the difference for our channel: one subscriber for every 30 views on our videos when we ask vs. one subscriber for every 60 views when we don’t.
What is the New YouTube Subscribe Button?
The new YouTube Subscribe button is a study in positive reinforcement; it’s like a celebratory emoji 🎉that sparkles (playfully) when a viewer decides to “hit that subscribe button.”
But there’s more to it than that.
There’s some contextual AI behind the scenes; whenever a creator says some variation on the tried-and-true “please like and subscribe,” the appropriate buttons will light up.
When a viewer responds and hits the like or subscribe buttons, they’re rewarded with a nifty little animation.
Pavlovian? Sure. Neat-o? Absolutely!

Why the New YouTube Subscribe Button Matters
Like YouTube itself, it’s all about engagement. As creators, we’re used to saying some variation on “please like and subscribe (it really does help).” Because likes and subs really do help.
The new YouTube subscribe button demonstrates that YouTube understands.
As YouTube content creators who sometimes feel like we’re at the whim of theYouTube algorithm, this kind of attention to detail matters.
What Creators Need to Know About the New YouTube Subscribe Button
Verbal is Vital
The feature is activated by verbal cues. You have to say the magic words; it won’t trigger based on on-screen text.
Slow Down
Animations will only appear a maximum of three times per video, and only when there are at least three minutes between each instance. You can’t spam it.
It’s About Connection
Creators should use the feature as YouTube intends: to build a connection with your audience.
New YouTube Subscribe Button: When to Ask for Subs
The new YouTube subscribe button is more than a neat visual gimmick. It’s a powerful tool in the hands of creators who understand its potential and use it effectively. As you craft your content, consider the right time to thoughtfully evoke this new YouTube subscribe button behavior and you’ll already be ahead of the game.

The New YouTube Subscribe Button is Awesome: Video Transcript
I’m excited to tell you that YouTube has just made it a little bit easier to get subscribers – Alongside. Eight new updates are changes to the like and subscribe button. No, no, no, no. This time it’s good. Check – This out. – After you upload a video, YouTube scans it to understand what’s being said.
And now when creators say words like, like, or subscribe, YouTube will add a visual cue over the corresponding button as a way to prompt viewers to click. The animation looks like this, and as you can see, it’s synchronized with the words that are spoken in the video. Once your viewer clicks the button, they’ll be rewarded with what YouTube calls “playful sparkles.”
Playful sparkles. That’s cute.
It’s a pretty well-known marketing principle that interactive and dynamic elements such as animations can enhance user experience and engagement.
Animations can make the content more appealing and can attract viewers attention, encouraging them to interact with the content, such as liking and subscribing.
Ah, this is perfect because it’s already hard enough to get subscribers and to have this animation that’s going to guide viewers to taking that action. When we ask for it, it’s just gonna help us out a ton.
But this feature does have some restrictions. The animations won’t appear every time the words are said.
They are limited to three times per video, and there must be at least three minutes between each instance. This ensures that the feature is used effectively without overwhelming viewers. Okay, – I’m gonna talk about it…
I know there’s so many creators who are pretty much saying, no, I’m not gonna do it. It feels like begging. I don’t wanna beg my subscribers to do anything. I just wanna warn you that that mindset lost our channel 150,000 subscribers.
I’ll explain – Since 2022, I rarely asked viewers to like or subscribe. I just focused on providing value and hoped that they would, and that got us to 750,000 subscribers.
That’s not bad, – But a few months ago I began asking for subscribers right in the middle content — nothing crazy, really short, really simple — and the results are crazy.
Instead of gaining one subscriber for every 60 views that a video got, we started gaining one subscriber for every 30 views. That’s double as much. I did the math, and if we would’ve started doing this at the beginning of the year, we would’ve had 900,000 subscribers today.
And not to mention, we didn’t see any negative impact on our retention. – Hey, hey, that… that’s the results that we got. And at the end of the day, you make your own choice. But if it’s up to me, I say yes: start asking for subscribers in your content right now, because imagine the impact doubling your subscriber rate will have on your channel over the course of a year, two years, three years for the lifetime of your channel.
It’s crazy. It’s absolutely crazy.
Study after study shows that animations used to highlight actions or key information can significantly increase user engagement. So now your verbal call to actions that were already effective will have an additional visual cue to support them, and you can expect to see an increase in engagement in subscribers because of it.
But this feature will only work if you say it. So there’s none of this just tossing it on screen or just hoping that it happens. We have to make it verbal. All right?
Okay.
Let me know in the comments: what do you think about this update? If your channel is under a thousand subscribers, I talk about this method, along with a few other methods, inthis video right here.
Please like, please subscribe and I’ll see you in the next video.
Keep creating.

Do YouTube Shorts Help Your Channel: 2023 Growth Strategy
YouTube Shorts can help you deliver content to a large audience and grow your channel. This time-saving content represents an excellent opportunity for YouTube content creators to scale and improve their channel growth and boost the engagement rate.
Do youtube shorts help your channel grow? Yes. A solid YouTube Shorts strategy is important, even for long-form creators.
In this post, we are going to cover the basics, tips, and growth strategies to help your channel grow with Shorts.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
Do YouTube Shorts Help your Channel Get More Views?
Yes – YouTube Shorts will help your channel get more views with the right content and content optimization. And the more views your channel gets, the higher the chance to gain more subscribers and monetize your content.
If you quickly look at the#Shorts landing pageon YouTube, you’ll understand how effective this content can be. This is whysmall channels should start posting YouTube shorts.
Find more statistics atStatista
So yes, the statistics show massive growth in YouTube Shorts from 2022 – 2023; a 25% gain in monthly views year-on-year (YoY). But how do creators get a piece of the action? It’s all about being smart and strategic: optimizing your videos and descriptions, doing keyword research, engaging your community, taking hints from your successful long-form videos to find inspiration or straight-up clips that can create the foundation of your YouTube shorts strategy.
In every case, TubeBuddy can help. Giving creators an unfair advantage on YouTube is what we do.
YouTube Shorts: The Basics Creators Need to Know
Before we dive into using Shorts as a channel growth strategy, let’s confirm some basics of the feature.
The Benefits of YouTube Shorts on Your Channel
Let’s check some of the most important benefits that YouTube Shorts can provide for your channel.
Creating YouTube Shorts Doesn’t Require Heavy Editing
Considering a YouTube short is easier to make and requires less time to record and publish, it’s also more compact than a regular video. YouTube Shorts don’trequireheavy editing to be successful but if editing is your thing, your content won’t be out of place.
Whencreating YouTube Shorts, you’re working with footage of a maximum of 60 seconds. And the shorter your YouTube material is, the less time you’ll spend on editing your video.
You Can Earn Money by Making YouTube Shorts
Because Shorts are shorter than standard YouTube videos, they don’t have mid-roll ads. That makes Shorts harder to monetize directly but YouTube does give creators a cut of all ads that appear before or after a view of their Shorts content.
Shorts can be monetized via AdSense only if:
Growth Potential With YouTube Shorts Niches
One of the most important factors for creating successful YouTube content is understanding what niches you find engaging and interesting to viewers. But sometimes, even the biggest YouTube content creators need some time to come up with an idea.
YouTube Shorts have a variety of popular niches that can easilymake a YouTube Short blow-up, so it’s easier to see what niches of content are the most engaging to viewers and bring the most clicks.
Here are tenYouTube Shorts nichesthat are going viral in 2023 and can bring views fast:
On the other hand, keep in mind that these niches are the most viral ones at the moment. Competition can really strong, really fast and it’ll be difficult (but not impossible) for smaller creators to stand out.
The best advice is to always think about how your content serves a viewer need. Even in video games — by far the most saturated content niche — there are opportunities for creators who have something different to offer.
You Can Repurpose Your Long-Form Video Into a YouTube Short
Another important benefit of creating YouTube Shorts is that you can always use your long-form videos and take small bits and pieces from them for your YouTube Short.
If yourepurpose your long-form content into a YouTube Short, you can save time on both the creating and editing processes.
Since YouTube Shorts are… short, people can watch a lot more of them in a sitting. Your chances of getting seen are better and you can use the opportunity to promote your long-form videos to drive views and subscribers to your main content.
For example, you could create a YouTube Short that features the most entertaining or important parts of a long-form video.
Pro tip:If you already have an uploaded video, you can also use the ‘’Remix’’ feature from YouTube Shorts to cut out snippets from your long-form video.
In a recent update to YouTube Shorts, YouTube removed linked URLs in Shorts comments and descriptions. At the same time though, they made it easier for creators to link to long-form videos from Shorts. The change is a net-positive for creators and viewers alike. It cuts down on the spam and scam comments while offering viewers a clear path from Shorts videos to long-form videos.
You can also use TubeBuddy’sSuggested Shortsfeature to discover your best-performing bits of video and turn them into Shorts.

How do YouTube Shorts help your channel grow?
The most exciting benefit of Shorts is potential exposure. Like TikTok, it can be very easy to quickly get in front of a large audience, which is ideal for reaching viewers with shorter attention spans.
Even more exciting is that your content can be served to non-subscribers, opening up a new potential audience.
YouTube has also ensured the subscriber box is always visible when you post a Short, making it easy to subscribe if people like what they see.
Of course, like regular videos, you’ll need to offer value to the viewer in whatever form your Shorts take. But there are some tricks you can take advantage of to give you a kickstart:
Keep it Snappy
If you’re used to publishing successful long-form videos on YouTube, you know about hooks. On Shorts though, you have even less time to engage a viewer’s attention; you need to hook them in the first second or two or they’ll swipe away.
Always Add Value
Think about the value your content can offer to the audience. Where possible, align the content with the viewer’s goals, or address a pain point the viewer has. This will vary by niche, of course. Just think about what problems your ideal viewer has, or what information would be valuable to them and create short-form content that helps.
Use Replays
Shorts are played on a loop. If you master the loop form, you can add a multiplier to your view count.  Consider consider how your content will come across not just from start to finish, but from finish to start.
You’ve probably seen this in action. It can be as simple as ending your video with something like “and that’s how…”
Three Key Factors to Boost Your YouTube Shorts
YouTube Shorts have potential for creators and can even out-perform long-form videos. But as with any other content, you should have a plan when starting out.
Let’s go through the three best ways to get started with Shorts to give the most value to your viewers and get the most value for your channel.
Familiarize Yourself With the Platform
Before jumping right into content creation, scroll through YouTube Shorts to see what other creators are making. Familiarize yourself with hot topics and popular sounds. Get a sense for the formats that work. Think about how these things might apply to your content.
Trends come and go but best practices have a longer shelf life.
Use the search functions across platforms to discover trends in your niche or, better yet, find ways to apply popular sounds to your industry and experiences.
YouTube Shorts tl;dr
Shorts are short. It’s right there in the name. Hook your audience up front. Skip the long intros. Deliver value. Think about your specific niche and how you can use the Shorts format to deliver content that provides value.
Build a Community
While Shorts are effective for sharing your content with new audiences, the platform also provides a new opportunity to engage with your existing fanbase.
Creators can respond to comments on longer videos and Shorts with a Short. The result is a more informal two-way conversation in contrast to the traditional one-sided—often heavily edited—main channel video.

Suggested Shorts uses AI and YouTube data to help creators  tool helps content creators capitalize on YouTube Shorts trends by highlighting areas of long-form videos that could make great Shorts.
We could write a whole blog post just on TubeBuddy Suggested Shorts, discussing “do YouTube Shorts help your channel grow” (oh wait,we did) but here are the basics on how to use this helpful feature.
How to use TubeBuddy Suggested Shorts
Shorts aren’t going anywhere, so now is the time to jump on board. YouTube is investing in Shorts by regularly adding and updating features.
Five Great Ideas for YouTube Shorts Content
The ways you can provide value to your audience and beyond via Shorts come in many forms. Whether it’s offering some quick tips, a quick-hit how-to, something fun, crazy, engaging, or just plain entertaining, there’s no end of topics you can cover.
Here are five thought starters to get you thinking about how to use YouTube Shorts… even if you’re traditionally a long-form video creator.
Promote Your Regular Channel
Use YouTube Shorts to promote and grow your regular channel. Every time you post a Short, it’s an opportunity for your content to get a view, and that view could turn into a channel subscriber or someone who engages with your main channel content.
Tease Your Audience
Use the format to whet the appetite about what’s coming in a longer-form video.
Behind-the-scenes Footage
BTS footage is a fun way to let viewers into your world and can make entertaining, relatively low-lift YouTube Shorts content.
Spoil your long-form content
Give YouTube Shorts viewers the tl;dr. Sharing the key points and take-aways can pique curiosity and interest, driving viewers to your long-form videos or better yet, to hit the subscribe button..
Jump on Trends
Don’tjustjump on trends but if a given trend has implications for your niche, or if a trend sparks a great idea, act fast. Create a Short and publish it before the trend has run its course.
Should You Make a Separate Channel for YouTube Shorts?
There is no hard-and-fast answer here. A strong argument can be made for either case. It all comes down to what makes sense for you, your content, and your overall content strategy.
Some creators choose to start separate channels for Shorts content. This can be a wise move if the videos will be radically different from your usual content.
Some YouTubers are creating new channels so their short-form and long-form content can remain separate.
Take MrBeast, for example, whose Shorts channel has generated nearly 30.3M million subscribers and over 1.4 billion views to date:
However, any new subscribers you generate for your channel from Shorts will, by default, resonate with your short-form content. However, while shorts get you new subs, these same subs will only look to see new shorts and not your longer videos.
However, if you enjoy making Shorts and the content is related to your long-form video, it might make the most sense to continue posting to your existing channel.

Do YouTube Shorts Help Your Channel: 2023 Growth Strategy
YouTube Shorts can help you deliver content to a large audience and grow your channel. This time-saving content represents an excellent opportunity for YouTube content creators to scale and improve their channel growth and boost the engagement rate.
Do youtube shorts help your channel grow? Yes. A solid YouTube Shorts strategy is important, even for long-form creators.
In this post, we are going to cover the basics, tips, and growth strategies to help your channel grow with Shorts.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
Do YouTube Shorts Help your Channel Get More Views?
Yes – YouTube Shorts will help your channel get more views with the right content and content optimization. And the more views your channel gets, the higher the chance to gain more subscribers and monetize your content.
If you quickly look at the#Shorts landing pageon YouTube, you’ll understand how effective this content can be. This is whysmall channels should start posting YouTube shorts.
Find more statistics atStatista
So yes, the statistics show massive growth in YouTube Shorts from 2022 – 2023; a 25% gain in monthly views year-on-year (YoY). But how do creators get a piece of the action? It’s all about being smart and strategic: optimizing your videos and descriptions, doing keyword research, engaging your community, taking hints from your successful long-form videos to find inspiration or straight-up clips that can create the foundation of your YouTube shorts strategy.
In every case, TubeBuddy can help. Giving creators an unfair advantage on YouTube is what we do.
YouTube Shorts: The Basics Creators Need to Know
Before we dive into using Shorts as a channel growth strategy, let’s confirm some basics of the feature.
The Benefits of YouTube Shorts on Your Channel
Let’s check some of the most important benefits that YouTube Shorts can provide for your channel.
Creating YouTube Shorts Doesn’t Require Heavy Editing
Considering a YouTube short is easier to make and requires less time to record and publish, it’s also more compact than a regular video. YouTube Shorts don’trequireheavy editing to be successful but if editing is your thing, your content won’t be out of place.
Whencreating YouTube Shorts, you’re working with footage of a maximum of 60 seconds. And the shorter your YouTube material is, the less time you’ll spend on editing your video.
You Can Earn Money by Making YouTube Shorts
Because Shorts are shorter than standard YouTube videos, they don’t have mid-roll ads. That makes Shorts harder to monetize directly but YouTube does give creators a cut of all ads that appear before or after a view of their Shorts content.
Shorts can be monetized via AdSense only if:
Growth Potential With YouTube Shorts Niches
One of the most important factors for creating successful YouTube content is understanding what niches you find engaging and interesting to viewers. But sometimes, even the biggest YouTube content creators need some time to come up with an idea.
YouTube Shorts have a variety of popular niches that can easilymake a YouTube Short blow-up, so it’s easier to see what niches of content are the most engaging to viewers and bring the most clicks.
Here are tenYouTube Shorts nichesthat are going viral in 2023 and can bring views fast:
On the other hand, keep in mind that these niches are the most viral ones at the moment. Competition can really strong, really fast and it’ll be difficult (but not impossible) for smaller creators to stand out.
The best advice is to always think about how your content serves a viewer need. Even in video games — by far the most saturated content niche — there are opportunities for creators who have something different to offer.
You Can Repurpose Your Long-Form Video Into a YouTube Short
Another important benefit of creating YouTube Shorts is that you can always use your long-form videos and take small bits and pieces from them for your YouTube Short.
If yourepurpose your long-form content into a YouTube Short, you can save time on both the creating and editing processes.
Since YouTube Shorts are… short, people can watch a lot more of them in a sitting. Your chances of getting seen are better and you can use the opportunity to promote your long-form videos to drive views and subscribers to your main content.
For example, you could create a YouTube Short that features the most entertaining or important parts of a long-form video.
Pro tip:If you already have an uploaded video, you can also use the ‘’Remix’’ feature from YouTube Shorts to cut out snippets from your long-form video.
In a recent update to YouTube Shorts, YouTube removed linked URLs in Shorts comments and descriptions. At the same time though, they made it easier for creators to link to long-form videos from Shorts. The change is a net-positive for creators and viewers alike. It cuts down on the spam and scam comments while offering viewers a clear path from Shorts videos to long-form videos.
You can also use TubeBuddy’sSuggested Shortsfeature to discover your best-performing bits of video and turn them into Shorts.

How do YouTube Shorts help your channel grow?
The most exciting benefit of Shorts is potential exposure. Like TikTok, it can be very easy to quickly get in front of a large audience, which is ideal for reaching viewers with shorter attention spans.
Even more exciting is that your content can be served to non-subscribers, opening up a new potential audience.
YouTube has also ensured the subscriber box is always visible when you post a Short, making it easy to subscribe if people like what they see.
Of course, like regular videos, you’ll need to offer value to the viewer in whatever form your Shorts take. But there are some tricks you can take advantage of to give you a kickstart:
Keep it Snappy
If you’re used to publishing successful long-form videos on YouTube, you know about hooks. On Shorts though, you have even less time to engage a viewer’s attention; you need to hook them in the first second or two or they’ll swipe away.
Always Add Value
Think about the value your content can offer to the audience. Where possible, align the content with the viewer’s goals, or address a pain point the viewer has. This will vary by niche, of course. Just think about what problems your ideal viewer has, or what information would be valuable to them and create short-form content that helps.
Use Replays
Shorts are played on a loop. If you master the loop form, you can add a multiplier to your view count.  Consider consider how your content will come across not just from start to finish, but from finish to start.
You’ve probably seen this in action. It can be as simple as ending your video with something like “and that’s how…”
Three Key Factors to Boost Your YouTube Shorts
YouTube Shorts have potential for creators and can even out-perform long-form videos. But as with any other content, you should have a plan when starting out.
Let’s go through the three best ways to get started with Shorts to give the most value to your viewers and get the most value for your channel.
Familiarize Yourself With the Platform
Before jumping right into content creation, scroll through YouTube Shorts to see what other creators are making. Familiarize yourself with hot topics and popular sounds. Get a sense for the formats that work. Think about how these things might apply to your content.
Trends come and go but best practices have a longer shelf life.
Use the search functions across platforms to discover trends in your niche or, better yet, find ways to apply popular sounds to your industry and experiences.
YouTube Shorts tl;dr
Shorts are short. It’s right there in the name. Hook your audience up front. Skip the long intros. Deliver value. Think about your specific niche and how you can use the Shorts format to deliver content that provides value.
Build a Community
While Shorts are effective for sharing your content with new audiences, the platform also provides a new opportunity to engage with your existing fanbase.
Creators can respond to comments on longer videos and Shorts with a Short. The result is a more informal two-way conversation in contrast to the traditional one-sided—often heavily edited—main channel video.

Generate Great YouTube Shorts Ideas with TubeBuddy Suggested Shorts
Good YouTube Shorts ideas can be the difference between racking up the views with short-form content or sitting on the sidelines and wondering “what if?”
Not only can YouTube Shorts drive views to your long-form videos, but you can alsomonetize short-form videostocash in on your YouTube Shortscontent.
If your long-form video game is on point but you struggle to come up with good ideas for YouTube Shorts, AI-poweredSuggested Shorts from TubeBuddycan help.
Why Create YouTube Shorts?

The key is to understand what your audience wants, then to find a ways to streamline the short-form video process.

Creator Spotlight: Films at Home – Long Live Physical Media
Check Out Jeff Rauseo’s Films at Home:
YouTube|TikTok|Instagram|X/Twitter|Facebook
In 2014, Blockbuster, the last of the national movie rental brick and mortars, shut its doors (mostly). About nine years later, in September 2023, Netflix stopped sending out itsred envelopes. And now, Best Buy is reportedly phasing outphysical media salesby the end of 2024.
If the digital age has got you down, then Jeff Rauseo’s YouTube channelFilms at Homeis here for you. On the YouTube channel and The Films At HomePodcast, Jeff provides updates, news, sources, and reviews concerning all things home movies. And while it is a niche interest, as Jeff and his 118K subscriber base can attest, physical media is not over.
As an avid film collector with thousands of Blu-rays and DVDs, Jeff’s reviews run the gamut, from the 4K UHD release of the classicSnow Whiteto one of Jeff’s favorite releases of the year,Spiderman: Across the Spider-verse. But ever since Jeff watched Jaws on VHS at age five, his passion has been horror. His in-depth editorials on the history of horror home releases are regularly featured onBloody Disgusting.
Films From Home was a runner-up in the Commentary category in the 2023TubeBuddy Emerging Creator Awards. Something that is no small feat, considering the tough competition in the online world of commentary.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
Q: Tell us about the journey that brought you to where you are today as a content creator.
A: I started my journey because I wanted to have a place to talk with other movie collectors and build a community. I also used my channel as an outlet to talk about movies and share my thoughts online. Even if no one ever watched, it would have been a good exercise to get things off my mind and out into the world!ow our intercultural world to people, so we picked up the camera & started making contents!
Q: How would you describe your brand as a content creator?
A: I would describe my brand as accessible, approachable, and knowledgeable. I did this to share my love for this hobby and to encourage others to join in on the fun while also talking about the pros of physical media in a digital world.
Q: What are the biggest challenges you face as a content creator?
A: Time! I work a full time job and have two little kids, so time is always the biggest challenge.
Q: What advice would you offer to someone just starting out as a content creator?
A: Just do it! I wish I hadn’t waited. Get out there, start shooting content, and start posting. You’ll never be perfect, and it takes years to improve (my early videos are a mess!) but until you start doing it, you can’t get better. Then just be consistent. Upload once a week, 2 times a month, whatever it is, just stick to it. It could take years before you see any money, so don’t do it for that reason. Do it because you have a passion and want to share that with the world.
Q: What has been your proudest moment as a content creator so far? Why was it so meaningful to you?
A: My 100k YouTube subscribers plaque was a big one, because I didn’t think it was possible. The largest channels in my niche still haven’t hit that number, so I always thought there was a ceiling, but I was wrong!
Q: What gives you energy as a content creator? What takes your energy?
A: Getting positive messages from viewers always gives me energy. When someone says I convinced them to start collecting, or I helped them find a new movie they loved, that’s the best part of it.
Q: What misconceptions about content creators do you wish you could dispel?
A: That we all make a ton of money and that it’s easy. I didn’t see a dime for 2-3 years. Hundreds of hours of unpaid work went into the channel before I could monetize it. It’s not easy, and even at 100k+ subscribers, it is a real effort to get paid for your work. That’s why I say it’s not about the money. The money is nice if you ever get it, but you have to be passionate first and do it for that reason.
Q: What is your ultimate goal as a creator? What steps are you taking to get there?
A: I’d love to hit 1 million subscribers and show the world that physical media is here to stay. I’d also love to expand beyond YouTube into writing books, making documentaries or films, and possibly go full-time as a creator if it works for me and my family.
Q: How did you discover TubeBuddy and what made you decide to try it?
A: I discovered TubeBuddy through a friend on LinkedIn, and their success with it made me give it a shot!
Q: How has TubeBuddy helped you grow your channel and improve your content?
A: It helped me tremendously because I never had end screens or anything on my videos. It allowed me to easily bulk add all of them to my channel. It also keeps me honest with channelhealth reports. And the newAI featureshave given me inspiration to try new topics, adjust video titles, and change thumbnail designs. It’s also super important to see what’s ranking on YouTube and how your videos rank. Much like google,search rankingis everything.
Q: What is your favorite TubeBuddy feature?
A: I love thethumbnail analyzerwhich helps me really nail down what will resonate to viewers. I use it to test thumbnail designs against one another before I go live.
Q: How would you describe TubeBuddy to a fellow creator?
A: It’s the YouTube cheat code. It has all of the tools you wish YouTube gave you, and more.
Thanks to Jeff for taking the time to share your thoughts and for using TubeBuddy. We can’t wait to see what’s next in the world of physical media!

How to Add a Thumbnail to YouTube Shorts
YouTube Shorts have become a popular way to share short, engaging videos with a wide audience. But adding a thumbnail to your YouTube Shorts isn’t as simple as adding a thumbnail to your YouTube long-form videos.
Still, a great thumbnail can be key to catching the viewer’s attention.
We’ll walk you through the steps required to add custom thumbnails to your YouTube Shorts so your content stands out and attracts more viewers.
1. Designing the Perfect Thumbnail
The first step in adding custom thumbnails to your YouTube Shorts is tocreate the perfect thumbnail. It should be in a 9:16 format, which is the ideal size for Shorts.
Design a thumbnail that looks great, that grabs attention, and that tells viewers what your video is about. Viewers often decide whether to watch a video based on its thumbnail.
Make sure it piques curiosity and has depth and contrast to draw attention. If you’re new to creating compelling thumbnails, consider using graphic designtools or templatesto make this process easier.

2. Add the Thumbnail Image to Your Shorts Video
Custom thumbnail in hand, it’s time for the next step: getting it into your Shorts video.
Add the thumbnail image to the beginning or end of your video’s timeline. Don’t worry about this disrupting your video’s content; we’ll be fixing it later in the editing process. This addition is essential because it helps your Shorts look more professional and increases their click-through rate.
3. Uploading Your Edited Video
After adding the custom thumbnail to your video, export the video and transfer it to your phone.
Open the YouTube app and create a Short. Add the edited video to your Shorts library and follow the standard upload process.
On the video Details page, you’ll find a pencil icon next to the image. Tap it, and you’ll be able to scrub the timeline to select your custom thumbnail image.
Fill in the rest of the video details as you normally would, including title, description, and tags. Once everything is set, just hit upload.
4. Trim Your Video in YouTube Studio
To complete the process, head over to the video Details page in the YouTube Studio app on your desktop.
Select the video edit option, and there you’ll find the trim and cut feature. This is where you’ll remove the part of the video containing the custom thumbnail image, leaving you with your original YouTube Short.
Trimming is essential to ensure that your Shorts look clean and professional, as viewers often judge the video’s quality based on the opening moments.
Custom thumbnails are an integral part of making your YouTube Shorts stand out in a crowded platform. Adding a thumbnail in YouTube Shorts requires some work-around steps but the extra effort is worth it.
A compelling thumbnail is often the first impression viewers have of your video, soinvesting time and effortinto creating one is well worth it. So, get creative, design your custom thumbnail so your YouTube Shorts stand out.
Now, it’s time to put these steps into action and enhance the visual appeal of your Shorts, attracting more viewers and growing your channel. Happy Short-making!

How to Add a Thumbnail to YouTube Shorts
YouTube Shorts have become a popular way to share short, engaging videos with a wide audience. But adding a thumbnail to your YouTube Shorts isn’t as simple as adding a thumbnail to your YouTube long-form videos.
Still, a great thumbnail can be key to catching the viewer’s attention.
We’ll walk you through the steps required to add custom thumbnails to your YouTube Shorts so your content stands out and attracts more viewers.
1. Designing the Perfect Thumbnail
The first step in adding custom thumbnails to your YouTube Shorts is tocreate the perfect thumbnail. It should be in a 9:16 format, which is the ideal size for Shorts.
Design a thumbnail that looks great, that grabs attention, and that tells viewers what your video is about. Viewers often decide whether to watch a video based on its thumbnail.
Make sure it piques curiosity and has depth and contrast to draw attention. If you’re new to creating compelling thumbnails, consider using graphic designtools or templatesto make this process easier.

2. Add the Thumbnail Image to Your Shorts Video
Custom thumbnail in hand, it’s time for the next step: getting it into your Shorts video.
Add the thumbnail image to the beginning or end of your video’s timeline. Don’t worry about this disrupting your video’s content; we’ll be fixing it later in the editing process. This addition is essential because it helps your Shorts look more professional and increases their click-through rate.
3. Uploading Your Edited Video
After adding the custom thumbnail to your video, export the video and transfer it to your phone.
Open the YouTube app and create a Short. Add the edited video to your Shorts library and follow the standard upload process.
On the video Details page, you’ll find a pencil icon next to the image. Tap it, and you’ll be able to scrub the timeline to select your custom thumbnail image.
Fill in the rest of the video details as you normally would, including title, description, and tags. Once everything is set, just hit upload.
4. Trim Your Video in YouTube Studio
To complete the process, head over to the video Details page in the YouTube Studio app on your desktop.
Select the video edit option, and there you’ll find the trim and cut feature. This is where you’ll remove the part of the video containing the custom thumbnail image, leaving you with your original YouTube Short.
Trimming is essential to ensure that your Shorts look clean and professional, as viewers often judge the video’s quality based on the opening moments.
Custom thumbnails are an integral part of making your YouTube Shorts stand out in a crowded platform. Adding a thumbnail in YouTube Shorts requires some work-around steps but the extra effort is worth it.
A compelling thumbnail is often the first impression viewers have of your video, soinvesting time and effortinto creating one is well worth it. So, get creative, design your custom thumbnail so your YouTube Shorts stand out.
Now, it’s time to put these steps into action and enhance the visual appeal of your Shorts, attracting more viewers and growing your channel. Happy Short-making!

How to use TubeBuddy: Do These 5 Things as Soon as You Install TubeBuddy! – Video transcript
Enrico Incarnati:
I’m going to show you the five things you need to do as soon as you install TubeBuddy.
With TubeBuddy you have an access to a range of optimization and AI tools designed to help you create manage and grow your YouTube channel. Here are my top five features that you should definitely try today.
Let’s talk about the keyword Explorer, personally this is one of the most underrated tools that will help you research your video ideas and take the guesswork out of what you need to make next.
Let’s say you’re a gaming channel and for the sake of this video we’re going to use Call of Duty. Personally Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 one of my favorite games. Just had to say that…
When I type in Call of Duty and I hit Explorer it’s going to give me an overall score score analysis Etc.
What I care about is over here on the right hand side where I can go between YouTube, Google, video topics, and comments tabs and I can look down here where it saysrelated searchesand I can see the type of videos that people are searching on YouTube.
Let’s come over here to the video topics and see what all the things people are searching for based off of what their interest is in.
Let’s click under the first related search under YouTube that says Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. When we click on that related search, we’re given multiple related searches around Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. As you can tell there’s a lot of related topics ideas all around one keyword. I encourage you to do some research on your own and play around with the Keyword Explorer. And let me know in the comments below if you do have any questions regarding the Keyword Explorer.
The next thing you need to do as soon as you install TubeBuddy is join our community.
One of the best things that you can do as a creator is connect with other creators and you can simply do that by joining the forum or the Discord server. This is a great way to get any questions you have answered answer anyone else’s questions and just connect with people overall and build new friendships and relationships.
The third thing you need to do — personally this is one of my favorites — is check out the Suggested Shorts feature.
This is super important because if you want to be a creator who not only grows but grows fast, you need to become what’s called a hybrid creator. Hybrid creators take advantage of posting short-form content and long-form content. However it’s not always that easy to create Short form content.
Click on the toolbox over here on the side and hit Suggested Shorts.
This is going to help you identify key points within your long-form videos to help you create captivating Shorts. You’ll see that it has time stamps at the points that the Suggested Shorts tool feels that that is a compelling Short for you to either pull from your video or recreate that part within your video and then post it to Shorts.
Again, if you want to become a creator that not only grows but grows fast you need to become a hybrid creator who takes advantage of posting long-form content and short-form content.
Next let’s talk about the Chapter Editor and video optimizations.
Chapters are a great tool to add to your videos they help you rank for SEO and allow the viewer to have a better viewing experience. Next time you go to upload a video, scroll down here to the right hand side and you’ll see the best practices and you’ll notice a section that says “add chapters now.” You can start adding chapters in your video.
The reason chapters are so important is because it helps you rank for SEO. Stay with me here. I’m going to explain this with the chapters in your video you give yourself a unique opportunity.
Depending on what your video is about and depending on the subject you’re talking about within the video, you can mark certain points within the video, creating the chapters that rank for SEO. Meaning you can title those chapters of things that people would be searching already on YouTube, even if that’s not the title of your video.
Let’s say for example you’re making a video reviewing the brand new iPad Pro let’s say within your review, one of the chapters that you’re talking about in one of the sections in your video was about editing videos on an iPad.
You could be giving a review your experience with editing videos and you could title that chapter “can you edit videos on an iPad?” because that is something people are searching. And although your video is not titled that, the fact that that’s in your chapter, and in your video, and in the description, it will rank.
I also love the Best Practices feature because it gives you a checklist of everything you need to do to optimize your video as fast as possible such as adding the chapters, a playlist, adding an end screen, info cards Etc.
Since we’re on the subject of chapters, we are on the final chapter of this video and before we get into the last part of the video: if you are enjoying this make sure you hit subscribe… and let’s get moving on.
Finally let’s talk about your member perks. As a Creator you need a lot of resources and tools. Tools for things like video editing, royalty-free music, and sound effects are often essentials.  You’d normally pay full price for these but we’ve secured discounts on popular tools you’re likely to need. Like free or discounted licenses for music and sound effects. There’s also a wide variety of member perks such as video and graphics services, and training, and mobile apps.
I hope this video helped and if you are brand new to YouTube and may be feeling a little bit lost and you want to learn more about subscribers getting more views getting more watch time, come check out this playlist right here and I can’t wait to see you in the forum!

12 Free YouTube Tools and Sites for Content Creators
Are you a small content creator eager to boost your YouTube channel’s growth? You’re in the right place! These are our top picks for 12 free YouTube sites and tools that can help you on your journey to content creation success.
Some of these tools operate on a “freemium” model but to make our list of the top 12 free YouTube tools and sites for creators, they are useful whether or not you decide to whip out your credit card.
Free YouTube tools – Quick links
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
ThumbnailCheck
ThumbnailCheck is your go-to tool for optimizing your YouTube thumbnails and titles. It allows you to preview how your titles and thumbnails will appear on both desktop and mobile, in light and dark mode, and even where longer titles will be cut off. Ensure your thumbnails and titles stand out before hitting that publish button.
Why it’s great
ThumbnailCheck helps you make a strong first impression, increasing the chances of viewers clicking on your content.
VocalRemover

12 Free YouTube Tools and Sites for Content Creators
These 12 websites and tools offer a wide array of resources to enhance your YouTube channel. Try them out, and see which ones work best for your content creation journey.
Whether it’s improving your thumbnails, enhancing your audio, or staying updated on the latest YouTube trends, these tools can help you reach your goals. Don’t forget to subscribe to the channels, platforms, and extensions that resonate with you, and most importantly, keep creating and growing!
Transcript: 12 SUPER USEFUL Websites for Small YouTube Channels
Today I’m gonna show you 12 useful and unique websites that are perfect for YouTubers who are hungry for growth. My goal is to share websites that you’ve never heard about before. From websites and tools that grant you insane abilities like adding features to YouTube. All of these are designed to help you grow your channel faster and completely for free, like completely for free.
First up is thumbnailcheck.com which lets you preview different titles and thumbnails on YouTube. You can see exactly how they will look on desktop and mobile, in light and dark mode, and even where longer titles will get cut off. It is a fantastic way to ensure your thumbnails and titles stand out before you publish.
Second is vocalremover.com. Just drag and drop any audio or video file and it will separate the vocals and music into two downloads. It is perfect for removing copyrighted background music or taking out the music that got baked into other videos. Let’s say you’re out filming and you forgot about the background music.
Just like that, it’s gone. Just add in your own royalty free music track so your video can get monetized. (upbeat music) Next is ytjobs.com. This is a job board focused on YouTube related jobs. Whether you’re a creator looking for gigs or a YouTuber seeking professionals like thumbnail designers, script writers, or video editors, this site is a gold mind.
You can see verified work, testimonials, and easily contact talent. Whether you are talent or whether you’re looking for talent this site is absolutely incredible. ElevenLabs is next. ElevenLabs. Elevenla. That is cray. I cannot say that quick. I gotta slow down. That sounds weird, but ElevenLabs is next. Listen, among all the text-to-speech websites, this one stands out to me as being the best.
The free version lets you turn up to 10,000 characters per month into natural sounding audio in 14 languages. It’s ideal for adding narration to your videos or creating YouTube Shorts. – Check this out. Watch this YouTube short that we’ve made with a real voice and a ElevenLabs voice. –
[Narrator]The most dangerous social media challenges.
First up is the Milk Crate Challenge. People stacked crates and tried to climb them like stairs. The crates would inevitably collapse, leading to broken bones and spinal cord injuries. Next is the Bird Box Challenge. People blindfolded themselves while doing daily tasks. Someone even did this while driving and crashed.
Tell me which one you like best in the comments. Next is Creator Insider, a YouTube channel run by YouTube employees. They share news, policies, and updates every single week. This is a YouTube channel ran by the people behind YouTube. These are YouTube employees. Yes, yes, the content is valuable. Every creator should be subscribed.
Now the next four are free browser extensions that make YouTube better for creators. Return YouTube Dislike brings back the public dislike count, even though YouTube removed it in 2021. If you’re like me and you find it helpful to see the dislikes on a video, this tool is for you. DF Tube. DF Tube helps you stay focused on YouTube by removing distractions like suggested videos and comments.
When you’re in consumer mode there is no problem falling down a rabbit hole of YouTube content that distracts you from your main focus. However, when you’re in creator mode and you need to get some serious research done or you need to look at specific videos without the distractions of eye grabbing suggested videos or all the deep diving into comments, this tool is great.
DF Tube lets you choose what you temporarily remove so you can get work done undistracted. I don’t know about y’all, but like I struggle to focus when all these things are distracting me. This tool has helped me. I hope that it helps you. Next is YouTube-Shorts Block. This gives you the option to completely hide shorts while you’re on desktop.
While I don’t use it for that, I do use it to watch YouTube Shorts on the regular YouTube interface rather than the shorts player. For me this is useful for research when you need to see information that would otherwise be hidden. And to see all this additional data, I use another tool. You’ve probably heard about this one, the TubeBuddy Browser Extension.
Within the TubeBuddy Browser Extension is a free tool called Videolytics. This feature shows additional data that doesn’t display publicly on YouTube videos. Like the tags that are helping a YouTube short get discovered. Now I know everybody has different opinions about tags on YouTube, but when it comes to YouTube Shorts, tags seem to play a higher importance over any other content type.
To the point that YouTube now encourages and suggests tags based on the content of your YouTube Shorts. Using the combination of these tools you can see the tags that are working for successful Shorts and consider adding them to your videos if they make sense. Before we move on to the last three tools I have a quick favor to ask you.
Around 68% of the viewers on this channel are not subscribed. My goal is to get that number down to 50%. If you like our content at all, please hit the subscribe button. I promise you that this helps more than you can imagine and the bigger the channel gets, the bigger the videos get. Thank you. And now onto the 10th tool.
Otter.ai is a free voice to text website and app that transcribes your audio into text. It’s often used for recording and transcribing meetings, but as a creator, this can be used to capture your spontaneous ideas. Whether I’ve just woken up or if I’m driving, if a brilliant video idea, script, title comes to my head I start to record it with Otter.
It transcribes the audio to text, ensuring I don’t lose a single thought. This is perfect for those moments where you just cannot stop to write or if ideas just seem to flow out better as you speak them. Number 11 is X, formally known as Twitter. YouTube is great for learning YouTube through video. Twitter is a treasure trove of insights and strategies from top creators and experts that often don’t make it into a video.
Let me go through my favorite Twitter accounts to follow. Should I be saying X account? I dunno, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know. I don’t know, you know what I mean. This is Mario. He’s the retention director who’s worked with major channels like Mr. Beast. He shares exclusive retention tactics and YouTube strategies that you will not find anywhere else.
Jay also dives deep into YouTube on different levels, but his invaluable knowledge on crafting click-worthy thumbnails is absolutely worth the follow. And then there’s two YouTube employees. First is Todd Beaupre who’s the product director managing the team behind the YouTube algorithm. Then there’s a YouTube liaison which is currently popular creator, Rene Ritchie.
They provide a blend of news, platform updates, and insightful commentary. If you don’t follow anybody else, follow those YouTube employees because the knowledge that they be dropping, you’re missing out if you’re not there. The 12th tool is Discord which has a ton of free servers run by creators.
These communities are filled with creators sharing their journey, insights, questions, and giving feedback. Now I would personally recommend starting with our Discord which I’ll leave right there and I know this sounds like a shameless plug, but our community is full of over 30,000 grinding creators. Whether you have questions about Shorts, analytics, or need feedback on your content and thumbnails, our team and thousands of active members are here to help you 24/7.
Plus I hang out there too, so join. All these tools will be in the description box below. Those are the 12 most powerful, insane, amazing tools that I use on a daily basis to help grow this channel and I really hope that it helps you. Please let me know which tool you are excited to try. Also, I made this video that teaches how smaller channels can grow using the community tab.
I really hope you check that out next and don’t, don’t you dare forget to subscribe. I love you all and I’ll hang out with you in the next video. See ya, peace.

DF Tube lets you choose what you temporarily remove so you can get work done undistracted. I don’t know about y’all, but like I struggle to focus when all these things are distracting me. This tool has helped me. I hope that it helps you. Next is YouTube-Shorts Block. This gives you the option to completely hide shorts while you’re on desktop.
While I don’t use it for that, I do use it to watch YouTube Shorts on the regular YouTube interface rather than the shorts player. For me this is useful for research when you need to see information that would otherwise be hidden. And to see all this additional data, I use another tool. You’ve probably heard about this one, the TubeBuddy Browser Extension.
Within the TubeBuddy Browser Extension is a free tool called Videolytics. This feature shows additional data that doesn’t display publicly on YouTube videos. Like the tags that are helping a YouTube short get discovered. Now I know everybody has different opinions about tags on YouTube, but when it comes to YouTube Shorts, tags seem to play a higher importance over any other content type.
To the point that YouTube now encourages and suggests tags based on the content of your YouTube Shorts. Using the combination of these tools you can see the tags that are working for successful Shorts and consider adding them to your videos if they make sense. Before we move on to the last three tools I have a quick favor to ask you.
Around 68% of the viewers on this channel are not subscribed. My goal is to get that number down to 50%. If you like our content at all, please hit the subscribe button. I promise you that this helps more than you can imagine and the bigger the channel gets, the bigger the videos get. Thank you. And now onto the 10th tool.
Otter.ai is a free voice to text website and app that transcribes your audio into text. It’s often used for recording and transcribing meetings, but as a creator, this can be used to capture your spontaneous ideas. Whether I’ve just woken up or if I’m driving, if a brilliant video idea, script, title comes to my head I start to record it with Otter.
It transcribes the audio to text, ensuring I don’t lose a single thought. This is perfect for those moments where you just cannot stop to write or if ideas just seem to flow out better as you speak them. Number 11 is X, formally known as Twitter. YouTube is great for learning YouTube through video. Twitter is a treasure trove of insights and strategies from top creators and experts that often don’t make it into a video.
Let me go through my favorite Twitter accounts to follow. Should I be saying X account? I dunno, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know. I don’t know, you know what I mean. This is Mario. He’s the retention director who’s worked with major channels like Mr. Beast. He shares exclusive retention tactics and YouTube strategies that you will not find anywhere else.
Jay also dives deep into YouTube on different levels, but his invaluable knowledge on crafting click-worthy thumbnails is absolutely worth the follow. And then there’s two YouTube employees. First is Todd Beaupre who’s the product director managing the team behind the YouTube algorithm. Then there’s a YouTube liaison which is currently popular creator, Rene Ritchie.
They provide a blend of news, platform updates, and insightful commentary. If you don’t follow anybody else, follow those YouTube employees because the knowledge that they be dropping, you’re missing out if you’re not there. The 12th tool is Discord which has a ton of free servers run by creators.
These communities are filled with creators sharing their journey, insights, questions, and giving feedback. Now I would personally recommend starting with our Discord which I’ll leave right there and I know this sounds like a shameless plug, but our community is full of over 30,000 grinding creators. Whether you have questions about Shorts, analytics, or need feedback on your content and thumbnails, our team and thousands of active members are here to help you 24/7.
Plus I hang out there too, so join. All these tools will be in the description box below. Those are the 12 most powerful, insane, amazing tools that I use on a daily basis to help grow this channel and I really hope that it helps you. Please let me know which tool you are excited to try. Also, I made this video that teaches how smaller channels can grow using the community tab.
I really hope you check that out next and don’t, don’t you dare forget to subscribe. I love you all and I’ll hang out with you in the next video. See ya, peace.

How Does YouTube Recommend Videos (and Why it’s Not Recommending Yours)
How does YouTube recommend videos and more to the point, how do you, as a creator, get it to recommend yours?
The words “YouTube Algorithm” can strike fear in the heart of a creator trying to grow their channel. There are numerous creators who’ll tell you a horror story about how they fell victim to a change in it. There are many myths surroundinghow YouTube’s algorithms work.
YouTubers have a ton questions about how YouTube videos get recommended: how long does it take a video to get picked up by YouTube’s systems? Do subscriptions factor in? But they all come down to one thing: how do I get YouTube to recommend my videos?
Cristos Goodrow is the VP of Engineering at Google, and is in charge of, among other things, how YouTube recommends videos in viewer’s individual feeds. So whenhe talksabout the YouTube algorithm, YouTubers would do well to listen.
How Does YouTube Recommend Videos?
YouTube’s video recommendation algorithm does two basic things: it tries to understandvideosand it tries to understandviewers. It’s only goal is to connect viewers with videos they’ll enjoy. Or more simply, to keep viewers on YouTube for as long as possible.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
How Does Audience Retention Factor Into How YouTube Recommends Videos?
Is a viewer A watching 2m30s of a five-minute video better or worse than a viewer B watching three minutes of a 10-minute video? The answer isn’t simple. Maybe the five-minute video should have been a 2m30s video. Maybe the 10 minute video is broken into chapters and the viewer got everything they needed in the three minutes they watched.
The key consideration for the YouTube algorithm is how “satisfied” a viewer is with the content they watched.
YouTube has determined that viewers tend to be more satisfied if they’ve watched more of a video, but it’s not a perfect measurement and it’s not the only factor in how YouTube recommends videos.
But for simplicity, the more of your video viewers watch, the more YouTube’s algorithms are likely to recommend said video.
How Long Does it Take a YouTube’s Algorithm to Recommend a Video?
YouTube’s recommendation algorithm is always looking for signals and it doesn’t take long for a video to get seen. Whether that video gets noticed is a different discussion.
When new content is posted, the YouTube recommendation algorithm is looking for who would be interested in that content. At the end of the day, that’s all the algorithm wants to do; match viewers with content that will engage them and keep them on YouTube.
Suppose a viewer consistently watches videos from a particular channel and frequently watches new videos as they’re uploaded. It makes sense for YouTube’s algorithm to recommend new videos from that channel to that viewer.
But that’s not much help to a small or new channel because YouTube doesn’t have enough information.
Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been on YouTube for years, taking the time to properlyoptimize your videosis tried and true advice. Optimizing your videos helps YouTube to understand what your content is about… and that’s the first step to how the YouTube algorithm recommends videos.
Why Do Viewers Get Recommendations from Huge Channels They are Not Subscribed to?
How does YouTube recommend videos? The YouTube algorithm looks for videos it thinks people will watch and engage with. If a channel has a ton of subscribers, that’s a pretty good indication that people like the channel and it’s content. It makes sense to recommend that channels content to more people, including non-subscribers.
The challenge with small channels is that YouTube has less information about who the audience is for that channel. That makes it harder to recommend that channel’s videos. Again, ensuring your videos are optimized (TubeBuddy SEO Studiocan help) is key.
It’s important to remember that no YouTube creator started with a million subs and success doesn’t happen overnight.
Do the Number of Subscribers a Channel Has Influence Recommendations?
How does ratio of views-to-subscribers factor in to how YouTube recommends videos? According to YouTube, it doesn’t.
However, if a person is subscribed to a channel, then YouTube knows they’re at least familiar with that content. It’s an indication to the recommendation algorithm thatthisperson might also be interested inthatvideo, based on what they have watched recently or what topics they’re interested in.
However, if a channel hasn’t posted for a while or starts publishing very different content, YouTube wouldn’t necessarily keep recommending its content to viewers anymore.
If a creator uploads a new video to a channel that’s been on hiatus for a while, the recommendation system would start with the former subscribers and see if some were interested in the video. Only then might the algorithm push it out to a wider audience.
However, if the creator produces a very different kind of content than the old channel had on it, and it doesn’t pique the interest of early viewers or old subscribers, the system will have to start looking for a different audience for that new video. Or worse, not.
How Does YouTube Recommend Videos?The One Thing YouTube Creators Need to Know
Recommendations are all about trying to help a viewer find the videos that will be most satisfying to them. The only way to do this on YouTube is via personalization. YouTube is really just a collection of millions of niches, and even the largest channel on YouTube has a tiny audience relative to the overall size of YouTube. Only a fraction of a percent of viewers on YouTube watch even the largest channels, and so really, it’s about finding your particular audience.
If you want to know more about the YouTube Algorithm, check out our guide below:
Why isn’t YouTube Recommending Your Videos?
If you’ve read this far, it should be clear that YouTubewantsto recommend your content, but only if that content keeps viewers on the platform.
Creators need to meet YouTube halfway. At least.  If YouTube isn’t recommending your content, it’s probably because:
You Aren’t Optimizing your Videos
The YouTube algorithm is not magic. It’s a computer program;it’s just math. Take the time to properly optimize your video titles, descriptions, and tags and you’ll help YouTube’s algorithms to understand what your content is about. That understanding is key to how YouTube recommends videos. So help YouTube help you.Optimize your videos.
Your Content is All Over the Place
If you are throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks, your audience is going to get confused. If it’s confusing for your audience, it’s confusing for YouTube’s recommendation algorithm too.
By all means, experiment with your content but you need to decide on a topic and stick with it.
You Don’t Have a Consistent Publishing Schedule
YouTube is less likely to recommend your videos if your publishing schedule is all over the place. This is especially true if there’s a significant gap between uploads.
You don’t need to publish every day, but you do need to publish consistently.Create a content calendar.
Your Videos Suck
You don’t need to go all-in on production but you do need to create videos that are engaging and easy to watch.
YouTube wants to recommend videos that people will watch. The inverse is also true. MrBeast said it best:
We hope this post has given you more insight into how YouTube works. The platform wants you to succeed, so pick up that camera and create your next awesome video!

How Does YouTube Recommend Videos (and Why it’s Not Recommending Yours)
How does YouTube recommend videos and more to the point, how do you, as a creator, get it to recommend yours?
The words “YouTube Algorithm” can strike fear in the heart of a creator trying to grow their channel. There are numerous creators who’ll tell you a horror story about how they fell victim to a change in it. There are many myths surroundinghow YouTube’s algorithms work.
YouTubers have a ton questions about how YouTube videos get recommended: how long does it take a video to get picked up by YouTube’s systems? Do subscriptions factor in? But they all come down to one thing: how do I get YouTube to recommend my videos?
Cristos Goodrow is the VP of Engineering at Google, and is in charge of, among other things, how YouTube recommends videos in viewer’s individual feeds. So whenhe talksabout the YouTube algorithm, YouTubers would do well to listen.
How Does YouTube Recommend Videos?
YouTube’s video recommendation algorithm does two basic things: it tries to understandvideosand it tries to understandviewers. It’s only goal is to connect viewers with videos they’ll enjoy. Or more simply, to keep viewers on YouTube for as long as possible.

How Does Audience Retention Factor Into How YouTube Recommends Videos?
Is a viewer A watching 2m30s of a five-minute video better or worse than a viewer B watching three minutes of a 10-minute video? The answer isn’t simple. Maybe the five-minute video should have been a 2m30s video. Maybe the 10 minute video is broken into chapters and the viewer got everything they needed in the three minutes they watched.
The key consideration for the YouTube algorithm is how “satisfied” a viewer is with the content they watched.
YouTube has determined that viewers tend to be more satisfied if they’ve watched more of a video, but it’s not a perfect measurement and it’s not the only factor in how YouTube recommends videos.
But for simplicity, the more of your video viewers watch, the more YouTube’s algorithms are likely to recommend said video.
How Long Does it Take a YouTube’s Algorithm to Recommend a Video?
YouTube’s recommendation algorithm is always looking for signals and it doesn’t take long for a video to get seen. Whether that video gets noticed is a different discussion.
When new content is posted, the YouTube recommendation algorithm is looking for who would be interested in that content. At the end of the day, that’s all the algorithm wants to do; match viewers with content that will engage them and keep them on YouTube.
Suppose a viewer consistently watches videos from a particular channel and frequently watches new videos as they’re uploaded. It makes sense for YouTube’s algorithm to recommend new videos from that channel to that viewer.
But that’s not much help to a small or new channel because YouTube doesn’t have enough information.
Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been on YouTube for years, taking the time to properlyoptimize your videosis tried and true advice. Optimizing your videos helps YouTube to understand what your content is about… and that’s the first step to how the YouTube algorithm recommends videos.
Why Do Viewers Get Recommendations from Huge Channels They are Not Subscribed to?
How does YouTube recommend videos? The YouTube algorithm looks for videos it thinks people will watch and engage with. If a channel has a ton of subscribers, that’s a pretty good indication that people like the channel and it’s content. It makes sense to recommend that channels content to more people, including non-subscribers.
The challenge with small channels is that YouTube has less information about who the audience is for that channel. That makes it harder to recommend that channel’s videos. Again, ensuring your videos are optimized (TubeBuddy SEO Studiocan help) is key.
It’s important to remember that no YouTube creator started with a million subs and success doesn’t happen overnight.
Do the Number of Subscribers a Channel Has Influence Recommendations?
How does ratio of views-to-subscribers factor in to how YouTube recommends videos? According to YouTube, it doesn’t.
However, if a person is subscribed to a channel, then YouTube knows they’re at least familiar with that content. It’s an indication to the recommendation algorithm thatthisperson might also be interested inthatvideo, based on what they have watched recently or what topics they’re interested in.
However, if a channel hasn’t posted for a while or starts publishing very different content, YouTube wouldn’t necessarily keep recommending its content to viewers anymore.
If a creator uploads a new video to a channel that’s been on hiatus for a while, the recommendation system would start with the former subscribers and see if some were interested in the video. Only then might the algorithm push it out to a wider audience.
However, if the creator produces a very different kind of content than the old channel had on it, and it doesn’t pique the interest of early viewers or old subscribers, the system will have to start looking for a different audience for that new video. Or worse, not.
How Does YouTube Recommend Videos?The One Thing YouTube Creators Need to Know
Recommendations are all about trying to help a viewer find the videos that will be most satisfying to them. The only way to do this on YouTube is via personalization. YouTube is really just a collection of millions of niches, and even the largest channel on YouTube has a tiny audience relative to the overall size of YouTube. Only a fraction of a percent of viewers on YouTube watch even the largest channels, and so really, it’s about finding your particular audience.
If you want to know more about the YouTube Algorithm, check out our guide below:
Why isn’t YouTube Recommending Your Videos?
If you’ve read this far, it should be clear that YouTubewantsto recommend your content, but only if that content keeps viewers on the platform.
Creators need to meet YouTube halfway. At least.  If YouTube isn’t recommending your content, it’s probably because:
You Aren’t Optimizing your Videos
The YouTube algorithm is not magic. It’s a computer program;it’s just math. Take the time to properly optimize your video titles, descriptions, and tags and you’ll help YouTube’s algorithms to understand what your content is about. That understanding is key to how YouTube recommends videos. So help YouTube help you.Optimize your videos.
Your Content is All Over the Place
If you are throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks, your audience is going to get confused. If it’s confusing for your audience, it’s confusing for YouTube’s recommendation algorithm too.
By all means, experiment with your content but you need to decide on a topic and stick with it.
You Don’t Have a Consistent Publishing Schedule
YouTube is less likely to recommend your videos if your publishing schedule is all over the place. This is especially true if there’s a significant gap between uploads.
You don’t need to publish every day, but you do need to publish consistently.Create a content calendar.
Your Videos Suck
You don’t need to go all-in on production but you do need to create videos that are engaging and easy to watch.
YouTube wants to recommend videos that people will watch. The inverse is also true. MrBeast said it best:
We hope this post has given you more insight into how YouTube works. The platform wants you to succeed, so pick up that camera and create your next awesome video!

Optimize your YouTube Description SEO to Rank Higher – Here’s How
When you optimize your YouTube video description, you have a better chance of people finding your video.
The YouTube description box is a huge opportunity for creators, a useful resource for would-be viewers, and an important signal for the YouTube algorithm and search engines like Google.
When creators perfectly optimize their YouTube descriptions — considering both viewers and the YouTube algorithm — they get more views, more subs, and more of every metric that matters.
A well optimized YouTube description tells YouTube what your video is about, and tells viewers why they should care (and watch).
Master the art of writing great video descriptions, and you’ll give yourself a head start. In this guide, we will show you how to do just that.
11 Tips Optimize YouTube Descriptions
We’ll be talking through optimizing YouTube video descriptions, not to be confused with your channel description.Your channel description is a goldmine. You need to optimize it well, but you don’t need to optimize it often.
On the other hand, you need to optimize your YouTube video description every time you upload.  So without further ado, let’s get to the optimize YouTube description tips!
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#1 Get the Word Count Right
Writing just the bare minimum in the description is an easy habit to pick up… but it’s the first one to break if you want to optimize YouTube descriptions for views. The best video descriptions have an average word count of 200 words or more.
You can use boilerplate copy across all your videos (andTubeBuddy Bulk Editing toolscan certainly help here) but you need at least a couple of well optimized, new paragraphs for each new video you upload.
#2 Optimize YouTube Descriptions: Do the Keyword Research
To really optimize YouTube descriptions, you need keywords that rank and that describe your video content. You need to give YouTube the information it needs to suggest your video when a viewer searches for content like yours.
There are ways to DIY your SEO butTubeBuddy SEO Studioand Keyword Explorer is key here. Read more on how tosmash YouTube keyword research with TubeBuddyto ensure you’re giving yourself the best chance to rank.
#3 Place Your Target KeywordsUp Front
Look at any of the best-performing videos on Google and YouTube search, and you’ll notice a pattern. The video descriptions are optimized for the keywords the creator aims to rank for.
Sprinkle your keywords throughout. Just remember you’re writing for human readers first, with algorithms a close second.Include your keywords early, in the first 70 characters of your description.
This is known as ‘Above the Fold,’ a fancy name for the copy visible to viewers without them having to click on the ‘Show More’ button.
In the example below, both the video title and the description for “YouTube Keyword Research – You’re Doing it WRONG!” have been optimized for the word ‘Keyword Research.’ It’s the focus of the video and a term that TubeBuddy wants to rank highly for on the platform.
#4 Research Related Keywords
In addition to your main keyword, try to find two or three other terms that are related to that primary term to help you rank higher. Viewers may be searching for a related term that you can still rank for.
Using our description as an example again, our main keyword focus is “Keyword Research,” but we’ve also included “YouTube Keywords” and “Keyword Explorer.” This reinforces the content’s focus and allows it to be found in Search for related phrases and terms.
Regarding the number of keywords you include, aim for around two or three references throughout the description. Don’t “keyword stuff,” though. TheYouTube Algorithmwon’t be fooled into ranking you any higher.
#5 Accuracy and Authenticity are Key
Adding inaccurate or misleading information in an attempt to optimize YouTube descriptions is a terrible idea. Disappointed viewers bounce and might even dismiss your channel entirely. YouTube notices these signals. Yourwatch timewill suffer… and maybe not just on the one video.
Ensure your speeling, grammer, and, punctuation are on point. Not only does this make your content feel more reputable but also, YouTube needs to index the words and understand the syntax. If words are misspelled or the idea is hard to parse, your video will suffer.
#6 Optimize YouTube Description and Stay On Brand
An optimized YouTube description is conversational and on-brand.
Every YouTube channel has a ‘voice,’ the same voice you would use in your videos. Reflect that tone in the description too.
#7 Ensure YouTube Description Content is Unique
If your description content is very similar to other video descriptions, you’ll harm your ranking ranking. This can be very common if you’re just using a sentence or two for your description, and it’s very similar to your other descriptions.
While Default Uploads (see below) take the hard work out of including the information you want to include each time, aim for at least a few sentences that are unique to that video.
#8 Nail Your Default Uploads
Default Uploadsis a YouTube feature applied to all of your videos. You can choose defaults (on desktop only) for your videos’ privacy setting, category, tags, comments, language, and titles and descriptions. Here’s an example of the current Default Uploads we use for TubeBuddy videos. As you can see, it includes an explanation of what TubeBuddy is and links out to other TubeBuddy resources and our social channels.
Optimize your defaults and you optimize every YouTube description going forward. Now all you need is a couple of good sentences… with the specific keywords you’re trying to rank for.
If you’re a TubeBuddy user, you can create multipleDefault Upload profilesfor each type of video you make. If you have aTubeBuddy Pro,TubeBuddy Legend, orTubeBuddy Enterpriselicense, you also get the option to edit these defaults in bulk, using our uniquefind and replace tool.
It’s a huge time saver for creators and having multiple profiles isn’t currently available on YouTube, sosign up to TubeBuddytoday to take advantage of this incredible tool.
#9 Use Your Hashtags
YouTube Hashtags allow creators to make the word or phrase clickable, so users can easily search for related videos tagged with the hashtag. It also allows the creator to connect their videos with other content that shares the same hashtag. They are also another great way to help YouTube understand what you’re video is about. You get three per description, so make sure you take advantage of this feature.
In the example below, you can see the creator has used his hashtag allocation to confirm his video is about Los Angeles as well as travel tips:
#10 Disclose All Sponsorship or Brand Deals
In the U.S., YouTube videos based on, or including, sponsorship deals must abide by the FTC and YouTube’s legal guidelines.
To comply with these guidelines, YouTubers must disclose which brands they are working with when posting sponsored content. If a creator has received a free gift, is tied into a brand deal, or includes some kind of product placement in their content, they need to clearly disclose it to their viewers within the video’s description. Read theFTC’s handy guide to disclosing sponsored content.
Many creators also include a disclaimer in their YouTube description if it is unclear whether their video has been sponsored. Inthis video, the creator reviews Charlotte Tilbury products but clarifies that the cosmetics company doesn’t sponsor the video.
#11 A/B Test Your YouTube Descriptions
If you’re on theTubeBuddy Legend Plan, you can easily perform A/B tests on any of your YouTube descriptions to identify what’s working for you. The data opens up a world of new insights that will inform you how your descriptions resonate with viewers. Follow along with our guide tosplit-testing YouTube descriptions (and titles)
If you aren’t optimizing your YouTube description, now is the best time to start. We hope our guide has given you some tips to get you started for making the most out of this awesome feature.

Creator Spotlight: Living the Dream & Doing the Work – The Kumaar Family
Check Out the Kumaar Family:
The Kumaar Family— Logesh, Rachel, Zaden, and Kyren — are a Malaysian-American family whose vlog-style content shares a slice of family life, couple life, and enough travel and food content to turn you (or at least us) green with envy.
The Kumaar Family were runners up in the Vlogging category in the 2023TubeBuddy Emerging Creator Awards. In addition to their vlog content, they also do fun skits and aren’t above pulling a prank or two.
As active TubeBuddy users, and with nearly 650K subs on YouTube alone, it’s clear the Kumaar Family’s content resonates. It’s equally clear they put a lot of effort into their content… in addition to holding down full-time jobs… in addition to being active and engaged parents to two young children.
We had a chance to ask the creators behind the successful and growing channel a few questions as part of the TubeBuddy Creator Spotlight series. Read on to learn what makes these creators tick, the challenges they face, their most exciting moments as creators and, of course, how they use TubeBuddy to helpramp up views, subs, and watch time.

Creator Spotlight: Living the Dream & Doing the Work – The Kumaar Family
Check Out the Kumaar Family:
The Kumaar Family— Logesh, Rachel, Zaden, and Kyren — are a Malaysian-American family whose vlog-style content shares a slice of family life, couple life, and enough travel and food content to turn you (or at least us) green with envy.
The Kumaar Family were runners up in the Vlogging category in the 2023TubeBuddy Emerging Creator Awards. In addition to their vlog content, they also do fun skits and aren’t above pulling a prank or two.
As active TubeBuddy users, and with nearly 650K subs on YouTube alone, it’s clear the Kumaar Family’s content resonates. It’s equally clear they put a lot of effort into their content… in addition to holding down full-time jobs… in addition to being active and engaged parents to two young children.
We had a chance to ask the creators behind the successful and growing channel a few questions as part of the TubeBuddy Creator Spotlight series. Read on to learn what makes these creators tick, the challenges they face, their most exciting moments as creators and, of course, how they use TubeBuddy to helpramp up views, subs, and watch time.

How to Make Money on YouTube as a Small Creator
You don’t have to wait tomake money on YouTube. In fact, you can start earning revenue from day one! If your channel hasn’t generated the required watch time hours or subscribers needed to join theYouTube Partner Program, you still have the potential to generate income with your content. In this post, we’ll look at three specific ways:
#1 Earn Commission as an Affiliate Marketer
#2 Sell Your Own Digital Products
#3 Make Money on YouTube with Sponsorships.
How To Monetize On YouTube Without 4000 Hours & 1000 Subscribers
In an exclusive video for TubeBuddy, creator Jessica Stansberry talks about three ways to make money on YouTube without being monetized. Watch the video below or keep reading for all the details:
#1 Earn Commission as an Affiliate Marketer
What is affiliate marketing? It’s when you get paid a commission to promote someone else’s service or product. This is usually achieved by providing a custom link to the product or service that tracks consumer activity on your affiliate account.
For example, you may create a video around a specific pair of headphones, then provide anAmazon affiliate linkin your description directing to that product. If a viewer clicks on your link and buys the headphones, you get a small commission!
Amazon is a great place to start with affiliate marketing because anybody can apply and be accepted.There are some rulesaround how much you have to sell in a specific time, but for the most part, it’s a pretty easy target for people to hit.
To learn more,read our extensive guide to the Amazon affiliate program for YouTube creators.
Almost every company has an affiliate marketing program – includingTubeBuddy! Look around for a product or service you can promote that’s a good fit for you and your audience.
How do you get viewers actually to click your affiliate links? There are a few ways to do that. You can ask them to in the video or add a call to action on screen. However, the most common option is to have your description ready with the affiliate links to share.
In the description of Jessica’s videos, she has links to her most frequently asked questions, such as what camera she is using or what software she loves. She puts the affiliate links to all those questions in her description box:
Adding these links to your description will be easy if you still have a small content library. But what if you want to update all your descriptions?
Luckily, TubeBuddy has the perfect tool for you if you have a Star or Legend license. With the ‘Bulk Find & Replace, Append & Remove’ tool, you can update all your descriptions in one go. If you have old videos, you want to add affiliate links to, this is such a time-saving feature.
#2 Sell Your Own Digital Products
Did you know that you can create and sell your own digital products and use YouTube to promote them? There are hundreds of digital products to create, including Canva or Photoshop templates or workbooks. They are anything that people can purchase that can make you some great money before you’re even monetized.
For example, you could create a video about how to grow on Instagram, and included in the video are the Lightroom Presets that you often use. You could create a template for those Presets that can be shared and sold for a few dollars.
If a viewer wants to purchase the assets, all they have to do is click that link, and you’ve made money.
Jessica has created an excellent video that gives youeight different ideas to start you off.
#3 Make Money on YouTube with Sponsorships
Brand sponsorships are an option for any creator if they have the right target audience reach and engagement.
If you’re a smaller creator, you’re probably not going to be able to make as much money as someone with 100,000  subscribers might. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t get sponsorships. There are a lot of companies out there that specifically want to pay smaller creators because they know their audiences are really engaged, and that can be really worth their money.
If there’s a product or a company that you absolutely love, it’s not going to hurt to reach out and see if they’re interested in a sponsorship deal.
You can absolutely get sponsorship deals from the jump, especially if you have other social media networks or other platforms that you can utilize to sweeten the deal a little. Perhaps you don’t have that many subscribers on YouTube, but you have two or three thousand followers on Instagram. That’s not a ton, but that’s enough for a brand to potentially see you as a benefit to them.
Start Making Money on YouTube Today
These are just three ways tostart making money on YouTube before your channel is monetized. Even if you are monetized, these will all work, too. Just remember to use YouTube as a business from the very beginning so you set yourself up to make money.
get an unfair advantage on YouTube
Give your YouTube channel the upper hand and easily optimize for more views, more subs, and more of every metric that matters.

Is TubeBuddy Worth It? Let’s Look at the Data
Is TubeBuddy worth it? Based on everything over 14 million creators tell us in feedback, on Discord, in surveys, and at meetups Yes, TubeBuddy is worth it.
If that’s all you needed to hear that’s great. You can download thefree Chrome extensionand/or hop on aTubeBuddy ProorTubeBuddy Legendaccount.
For everyone else, let’s dig into the data.
Actually, no. Let’s start with a question: why are you considering TubeBuddy? What led you to search for “is TubeBuddy worth it” or the ever-popular “is TubeBuddy safe” (it is) in the first place?
Boil it down, you probably want to grow your channel. You want more views and more subscribers, which translates to more clout and more money. Maybe you’re enticed byKeyword Explorerandupping your SEO gameboth on and outside YouTube. Maybe you’re looking to keep a closereye on your competitors, understanding and improving on their strategies, orcopying their tags. Or maybe it’s one of TubeBuddy’s over 70 AI, workflow, SEO, analytics, and batch YouTube tools.
Is TubeBuddy Worth It? The Data is In
You basically want to know if using the free version of TubeBuddy is worth your time, or whether upgrading to aTubeBuddy ProorTubeBuddy Legendaccount is worth your money. So we ran the numbers to look at YouTube channel outcomes for active TubeBuddy users and non-active TubeBuddy users. It really comes down to this:
If you use TubeBuddy,you will have better YouTube outcomesthan if you don’t.
The data is in: active TubeBuddy users get more views and more subs. Active TubeBuddy users, which we’ll define in a moment, see an86%lift in views and a55%lift in subscribers relative to those that start using TubeBuddy but who decide to go it alone (or perhaps choosea competitor instead?!)
The TubeBuddy Analytics team (thanks again Yusuf and Manali!) ran the numbers and made some powerful discoveries and a definitive answer to the question of is Tubebuddy worth it. Their analysis follows.
How We Selected Cohorts
To identify our cohorts, we looked at the anonymized results for creators that joined TubeBuddy between May 1 and July 31 2023 and who posted at least five videos to YouTube in that period. Our total sample size was 59,366 active creators.
Group A – Active TubeBuddy Users
Group Aused a TubeBuddy tool to completion at least 20 times in the period. For example, using TubeBuddy Keyword Explorer for SEO research then publishing the updated video title/description, or analyzing a thumbnail and going with TubeBuddy thumbnail recommendations, or any number of other things that TubeBuddy can do for creators.
Group B – Inactive TubeBuddy Users
Group Bsigned up for TubeBuddy and either didn’t use a TubeBuddy tool to completion or did so fewer than 20 times in the three month period. It’s important to note that these users continued to publish videos to YouTube… they just did so without actively using TubeBuddy.
Is TubeBuddy Worth It? Numbers Say Yes
Group A saw significantly higher growth on YouTube over the three month period compared with group B. Both groups comprise individual creators, each with their own unique style, each in their own content niche. From a data point of view, the only difference is that group A actively used TubeBuddy where group B did not.
Both groups are active on YouTube, publishing at least five videos over the three month period. Both groups show clear channel growth over that period.
Using TubeBuddy tools correlates to higher growth in both subscribers (group A: 89.40% vs group B: 57.39%) and views (group A: 170.85% vs group B: 91.37%).
It’s interesting that both groups show growth; whether group A or B, these are active YouTube creators who are clearly putting in the work and seeing results for their efforts.
There’s an episode of thePlanet Money podcastthat comes to mind here. In this episode, the hosts discuss parenting styles and draw a direct correlation between expectant or new parents buying parenting books and being a better parent. Notreadingparenting books; most go unread. Justbuyingparenting books. In other words, the content of parenting books may or may not make you a better, more engaged parent. Who’s to say? But the act of looking for and buying parenting books speaks volumes about your intent as a parent.
Through that same lens, installing TubeBuddy — which both of our cohorts did — speaks volumes about your intent as a YouTube creator. If you’re the type of YouTube creator who looks for tools to help you succeed on the platform, you have the right mindset and are predisposed to succeed on the platform.
In this case though, and with all else being equal, we have clear data that says taking that next step and activelyusingTubeBuddy in your YouTube will lead to even better outcomes.
Outcomes like an 86% vector on views and a 55% bump in subs over a three month period for those that actively use TubeBuddy tools vs. those that don’t.
So is TubeBuddy worth it?

Is TubeBuddy Worth It? Let’s Look at the Data
Is TubeBuddy worth it? Based on everything over 14 million creators tell us in feedback, on Discord, in surveys, and at meetups Yes, TubeBuddy is worth it.
If that’s all you needed to hear that’s great. You can download thefree Chrome extensionand/or hop on aTubeBuddy ProorTubeBuddy Legendaccount.
For everyone else, let’s dig into the data.
Actually, no. Let’s start with a question: why are you considering TubeBuddy? What led you to search for “is TubeBuddy worth it” or the ever-popular “is TubeBuddy safe” (it is) in the first place?
Boil it down, you probably want to grow your channel. You want more views and more subscribers, which translates to more clout and more money. Maybe you’re enticed byKeyword Explorerandupping your SEO gameboth on and outside YouTube. Maybe you’re looking to keep a closereye on your competitors, understanding and improving on their strategies, orcopying their tags. Or maybe it’s one of TubeBuddy’s over 70 AI, workflow, SEO, analytics, and batch YouTube tools.
Is TubeBuddy Worth It? The Data is In
You basically want to know if using the free version of TubeBuddy is worth your time, or whether upgrading to aTubeBuddy ProorTubeBuddy Legendaccount is worth your money. So we ran the numbers to look at YouTube channel outcomes for active TubeBuddy users and non-active TubeBuddy users. It really comes down to this:
If you use TubeBuddy,you will have better YouTube outcomesthan if you don’t.
The data is in: active TubeBuddy users get more views and more subs. Active TubeBuddy users, which we’ll define in a moment, see an86%lift in views and a55%lift in subscribers relative to those that start using TubeBuddy but who decide to go it alone (or perhaps choosea competitor instead?!)
The TubeBuddy Analytics team (thanks again Yusuf and Manali!) ran the numbers and made some powerful discoveries and a definitive answer to the question of is Tubebuddy worth it. Their analysis follows.
How We Selected Cohorts
To identify our cohorts, we looked at the anonymized results for creators that joined TubeBuddy between May 1 and July 31 2023 and who posted at least five videos to YouTube in that period. Our total sample size was 59,366 active creators.
Group A – Active TubeBuddy Users
Group Aused a TubeBuddy tool to completion at least 20 times in the period. For example, using TubeBuddy Keyword Explorer for SEO research then publishing the updated video title/description, or analyzing a thumbnail and going with TubeBuddy thumbnail recommendations, or any number of other things that TubeBuddy can do for creators.
Group B – Inactive TubeBuddy Users
Group Bsigned up for TubeBuddy and either didn’t use a TubeBuddy tool to completion or did so fewer than 20 times in the three month period. It’s important to note that these users continued to publish videos to YouTube… they just did so without actively using TubeBuddy.
Is TubeBuddy Worth It? Numbers Say Yes
Group A saw significantly higher growth on YouTube over the three month period compared with group B. Both groups comprise individual creators, each with their own unique style, each in their own content niche. From a data point of view, the only difference is that group A actively used TubeBuddy where group B did not.
Both groups are active on YouTube, publishing at least five videos over the three month period. Both groups show clear channel growth over that period.
Using TubeBuddy tools correlates to higher growth in both subscribers (group A: 89.40% vs group B: 57.39%) and views (group A: 170.85% vs group B: 91.37%).
It’s interesting that both groups show growth; whether group A or B, these are active YouTube creators who are clearly putting in the work and seeing results for their efforts.
There’s an episode of thePlanet Money podcastthat comes to mind here. In this episode, the hosts discuss parenting styles and draw a direct correlation between expectant or new parents buying parenting books and being a better parent. Notreadingparenting books; most go unread. Justbuyingparenting books. In other words, the content of parenting books may or may not make you a better, more engaged parent. Who’s to say? But the act of looking for and buying parenting books speaks volumes about your intent as a parent.
Through that same lens, installing TubeBuddy — which both of our cohorts did — speaks volumes about your intent as a YouTube creator. If you’re the type of YouTube creator who looks for tools to help you succeed on the platform, you have the right mindset and are predisposed to succeed on the platform.
In this case though, and with all else being equal, we have clear data that says taking that next step and activelyusingTubeBuddy in your YouTube will lead to even better outcomes.
Outcomes like an 86% vector on views and a 55% bump in subs over a three month period for those that actively use TubeBuddy tools vs. those that don’t.
So is TubeBuddy worth it?
That depends on whether or not you want 86% more views and 55% more subs…

The Biggest Challenges YouTube Creators Face (and How to Smash Them)
We recently asked our community of passionate and committed YouTube and other video content creators what kind of challenges they faced. As expected, a huge number of creators face similar challenges around channel growth and audience development. The main challenges revolved around:
5 Biggest Challenges YouTube Creators Face Today
YouTubers face several significant obstacles when it comes to growing their channels in today’s competitive digital landscape. These range from content creation to audience engagement and platform dynamics.
While YouTube offers revenue-sharing options through ads and memberships, it can be tough for creators to generate a substantial income, especially when they’re starting.If you want to make money on YouTube, you’ll need to develop a successful strategy that’s going to overcome the challenges all creators face.
How to Stand Out as a YouTube Creator
Content saturation on the platform is a very real issue, so you’ll need to give some thought to how you can pick your own unique lane. YouTube has millions of creators around the world, making it particularly challenging to stand out in the crowd for topics like gaming or lifestyle. Creators must constantly innovate and find unique niches or angles to capture and retain viewers’ attention if they want to grow their views and subscribers.
The key to standing out is understanding how YouTube works as a content destination. We are at least a decade past from the days when you could upload a video and rely on a few keywords to attract a significant number of viewers. YouTube looks for hundreds of signals that act as ranking factors for your content, including watch time, engagement, and viewer intent, and all the top channels understand how to craft their approach to give YouTube what it wants. It’s a vast subject with a steep learning curve. Luckily, you can download our free playbook, ‘The Complete Guide To Getting Your YouTube Videos Discovered’, and make a headstart on your growth.
Understanding How the YouTube Algorithm Works
YouTube’s constantly evolving algorithm can be unpredictable, making it difficult for creators to reach their target audience consistently. The algorithm’s favor often seems to shift, affecting a video’s visibility and discoverability.
Understanding how the algorithm works will help any creator to build on success. Check out our resource on ‘how YouTube promotes your content: understanding the algorithm and watch time,’ or watch our video ‘Do THIS YouTube Algorithm TRICK to Grow Your SMALL Channel FASTER’ for the basics.
Missing the Factors that Lead to Channel Growth
There’s no one big secret to YouTube channel growth but dozens, maybe hundreds of little tweaks that lead to an increase in engagement, views and subscribers. However, as you can see from the list provided, there are some strategies you just can’t ignore if you want true success.
In our ‘How to Grow on YouTube – 16 Tips’ post we break down some of the things you should be doing to build your presence, The great thing is that you don’t have to do them all at once – just make a start and when you see the difference it makes you’ll want to keep improving and achieving even more success.
How to Grab a Viewer’s Attention
YouTube is a busy, noisy, and overwhelming place, and as a creator, you’ll need 3 things to capture a viewer’s attention into the very few seconds they give to scrolling your content:
For custom thumbnails, do what the successful creators do and provide SOME indication of what the video is about, but create a ‘gap of curiosity, to spark more interest and draw the viewer in.
For video titles, the three most important aspects to make it click-worthy are emotion, relevance, and curiosity. Thebest YouTube titles drive increased click-through rate (CTR), which in turn drives watch time, subscribers, and every other YouTube metric that matters. In other words, good titles are vitally important
You only have a few seconds to hook your viewer, so there are some non-negotiable you should build into your content. You need to speak to a relatable problem or situation and also try and evoke a strong emotion.
How to Get Your Content Discovered
The ten minutes you’ll spend optimizing your YouTube videos for search can be the difference between racking up enormous views or continually fading into obscurity.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is how search engines like YouTube understand what your content is all about. SEO that helps your channel and your videos get found. SEO can be challenging, but using tools likeTubeBuddy’s SEO Studiocan give you ways to find more accurate keywords and help you in YouTube search so your videos are discovered!
YouTube creators face a complex web of challenges, from algorithmic unpredictability to monetization hurdles, content saturation, copyright concerns, and burnout issues. Overcoming these challenges requires resilience, creativity, and a deep understanding of the platform’s dynamics.
But if you’re passionate about making it as a content creator and you’re willing to learn the tricks of the trade, as well as put in the hard work, the rewards will be absolutely insane.

How to Do YouTube Keyword Research in 4 Simple Ways
As a YouTube creator, finding the right keywords and phrases is key to your channel’s success.
Why?
Because when viewers use specific words and phrases to search on YouTube, you want your video to be one of the top results they see. Keywords are also important in helping YouTube’s algorithms and your target audience understand the context of your video.
But conducting keyword research can seem overwhelming for those new to the process or unfamiliar with effective techniques.
Through this article, you’ll learn how to do keyword research for YouTube to give your videos a better chance of reaching a wider audience andgaining more viewsand engagement.

Keyword Research for YouTube
YouTube is a prediction platform. Its main goal is to anticipate what kind of videos will capture a viewer’s interest and retain their attention. So, getting your content to rank in search requires a specific search phrase and a highly intricatealgorithmthat considers various factors.
Let’s clarify something: keywords won’t have the same impact on small channel as they would on a larger or more established channel.
Suppose one creator has 100,000 subscribers while you have 1,000 subscribers. In this case, the larger creator holds more authority on the platform than you. So if you both went after a really competitive key term, the bigger channel would be more likely to rank for that keyword.
Yet, just because a YouTube channel has a smaller audience doesn’t mean keywords won’t work. You simply need to figure out which keywords are effective for your content.TubeBuddy Keyword Explorercan help.
How to do Effective Keyword Research for YouTube
Step #1: Use a Keyword Research Tool
Using a YouTube keyword research tool helps you identify popular search terms and phrases with high search volumes. These tools provide insights into competition levels, search trends, related keywords, and more, allowing creators to make data-driven decisions about their YouTube content strategy.
YouTube Keyword Research – You’re Doing it WRONG!
TubeBuddy is a free browser extension for — among many other things — YouTube keyword research. TubeBuddy Keyword Explorer helps you understand the relevant phrases that viewers on YouTube use in actual searches. This tool serves two main purposes:
Now, let’s select a topic to conduct some keyword research on. How about “sustainable gardening“?

As a content creator, you may wonder if it’s worth making a video about this niche topic.
The key to maximizing your chances of being discovered on YouTube lies in assessing the presence of other videos related to your chosen subject, particularly those with strong relevance, performance, and satisfaction metrics.
If you come across many videos that closely relate to your content idea, and they have attracted substantial views or engagements, it indicates a strong interest in the topic. On the flip side, this abundance of similar content might also suggest that the competition for visibility could be more intense.
Our search on “sustainable gardening” turns out to be a topic with a good number of monthly searches. The search volume for this topic is rated as “fair,” and an estimated 14.8K searches are conducted for this keyword.

2 important metrics you keep your eye on arecompetitionandoptimization strength.

Also, take a look at the bottom right corner. There, you’ll see a list of long-tail keywords connected to your main keyword—sustainable gardening. These words are really useful when you want to increase the likelihood of people finding your content in search results.

So, by understanding the competition, you can make better decisions about your content creation strategy. You may choose to differentiate your approach, offer a unique perspective, or turn your attention to related niches.

Step #2: YouTube Autocomplete
YouTube autocomplete is a feature that suggests search terms as you type into the search bar on YouTube. It is designed to make it easier for users to find videos on YouTube search results relevant to their interests.
According toGoogle, Autocomplete predictions are based on actual searches conducted on their platform. To determine which predictions to display, Google considers several factors, including:
Let’s see how it works. For example, let’s say we want to find ideas for the keyword “best vacation.”
When you begin typing this keyword on the YouTube search bar, it instantly suggests various related variations and keyword ideas. That’s a helpful and time-saving way of conducting keyword research directly on Youtube.

While YouTube’s autocomplete feature is useful, its predictions aren’t always perfect. Sometimes, you may come across unexpected suggestions that may not be entirely reliable, so they have a lower likelihood of leading you to reliable content.
Step #3: Analyze Competitor Videos
Another great way of conducting keyword research for YouTube is to review your competitors’ content, as this method can serve as a source of inspiration.
To begin, pull up some of your competitors’ videos and look through their video titles and descriptions. Take note of the specific keywords they use and how they incorporate them. By carefully analyzing their keyword choices, you can identify patterns and uncover the most relevant and high-performing keywords for your own videos.
Besides examining the keywords, observe whether your competitors employ any keyword variations. Variations in keywords can provide a broader reach and cater to different search queries. By understanding how your competitors use these variations, you can gain insights into how keywords can be used effectively and influence your own optimization strategy.
Lastly, pay attention to the flow and natural placement of keywords. This analysis will help you understand how to organically include keywords in your own content without appearing spammy.
Imagine you are a content creator specializing in car-related topics, specifically focusing on the “BMW M” series. Take a moment to review the below example, where you’ll notice some quick observations.
Firstly, you’ll notice that the seed keyword, “BMW M,” is seamlessly incorporated into the video title, instantly capturing the viewers’ attention. That part is easy to observe. However, what makes this example interesting is the strategic use of the seed keyword within the video description,specifically within the opening sentence.

While this method will help you get insights, you should never directly copy your competitors’ titles or video descriptions. After all, the goal is not to replicate them but to get inspiration to inform your content creation and optimization efforts.
Step #4: Find Trending Keywords Using Google Trends
Google Trends is a free tool that shows you how popular certain search terms are on Google using real-time data. When using Google Trends to search for a term or terms, you’ll be presented with a visual representation of its popularity over time. See the below example where we compared three terms:

As you can see, the time frame is set to “Past 30 days,” and the location is set to “Worldwide.” You can adjust those settings as per your needs.
The graph clearly indicates that the term “stock market” has been consistently more popular than other terms worldwide over the last month. Also, while the popularity of “NFT” and “cryptocurrency” has remained almost unchanged, the term “stock market” has seen significant spikes.
Take note that the numbers displayed on the graph don’t indicate the exact volume of searches, as the data is standardized and displayed on a scale of 0-100. So, the numbers accompanying the search terms represent cumulative totals.
How to optimize YouTube videos for keywords
1. Use SEO Studio by TubeBuddy
The TubeBuddySEO Studiois a tool provided by TubeBuddy, a popular YouTube channel management and optimization platform. Its purpose is to assist YouTubers in enhancing the visibility and viewership of their videos and channels through SEO.
The TubeBuddy SEO Studio analyzes your YouTube videos and channel and suggests the best keywords toenhance your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts.

SEO Studio includes features that allow you to optimize your video titles, descriptions, and tags for YouTube SEO, including the best YouTube keywords, search volume data, and more.

2. Optimize Video Description
Crafting descriptions using relevant keywords can enhance the discoverability of your videos in search results. Descriptions serve as a means to inform both the YouTube algorithm and your audience about the content of your video.
YouTube video descriptions are limited to a maximum of 5000 characters. We recommend providing each video with a unique description to optimize your video’s visibility. This helps with searchability and enables your content to stand out from similar content.

Additionally, consider including your social media profiles in the descriptions of your YouTube videos. These additional links can serve as CTAs for various purposes, such as directing viewers to your community, podcasts, or blog posts for more information. See the above video description forone of the TubeBuddy videos.
3. Use Video Hashtags
Hashtags help categorize and classify your video content, making it easier for viewers to find your videos when they search for specific topics or hashtags. They are also considered in search, but not as importantly as video title (first) and description (second). By including relevant hashtags, you increase the chances of your video appearing in search results or on the YouTube homepage when users explore related content.
Hashtags also allow you to reach a specific target audience interested in your video’s topic or theme. When users click on a hashtag, they are directed to a dedicated page displaying videos related to that hashtag. So, make sure you embed relevant hashtags into your videos.
4. Customize Your Thumbnail Image
The initial impression viewers get of your video is through its thumbnail, so it’s vital that it looks great and grabs attention. Remember that this can impact whether a viewer chooses to click on your video or not.
Plus, thumbnails often include elements like titles, text, and images that provide a preview of the video’s content. They can give viewers a sense of what to expect, helping them decide whether the video aligns with their interests or needs. Here’s an intriguing example of a customized thumbnail (if we do say so ourselves):
Another beauty of using custom thumbnails is that custom thumbnails allow creators to maintain a consistent visual style across their videos, establishing a recognizable brand identity. Using consistent branding elements like colors, fonts, or logos in thumbnails can help viewers associate them with your channel and content.
TubeBuddy offers theThumbnail Analyzer, a feature that allows you to assess various YouTube thumbnails and discover the most impactful for you. Our AI detects the elements in your thumbnails that attract viewers, such as text placement or other visual aspects. You’ll then receive a predictive score indicating the probability of attracting viewers and increasing video engagement compared to your current thumbnail.
5. Add Timestamps to Your Video
YouTube timestamps help improve the overall user experience and optimize your video’s visibility on the platform. By indicating the specific moments within your video, timestamps allow viewers to navigate to the most relevant sections that pique their interest.
These timestamps can be particularly advantageous for longer videos, such as tutorials, lectures, or interviews, where viewers may want to jump to specific sections without watching the entire video.
Streamline Your Keyword Research with TubeBuddy
Without a reliable keyword research tool like TubeBuddy, creators have to manually go through data, attempting to identify relevant keywords that can improve their YouTube visibility. This process is time-consuming and monotonous, taking away time that could be spent on creating high-quality content.
TubeBuddy presents a comprehensive solution to all the above challenges. TubeBuddy streamlines the keyword research process, helping creators find high-performing keywords for their target audience.Download the TubeBuddy extensionand get a head start on your competitors.

How to Do YouTube Keyword Research in 4 Simple Ways
As a YouTube creator, finding the right keywords and phrases is key to your channel’s success.
Why?
Because when viewers use specific words and phrases to search on YouTube, you want your video to be one of the top results they see. Keywords are also important in helping YouTube’s algorithms and your target audience understand the context of your video.
But conducting keyword research can seem overwhelming for those new to the process or unfamiliar with effective techniques.
Through this article, you’ll learn how to do keyword research for YouTube to give your videos a better chance of reaching a wider audience andgaining more viewsand engagement.

Keyword Research for YouTube
YouTube is a prediction platform. Its main goal is to anticipate what kind of videos will capture a viewer’s interest and retain their attention. So, getting your content to rank in search requires a specific search phrase and a highly intricatealgorithmthat considers various factors.
Let’s clarify something: keywords won’t have the same impact on small channel as they would on a larger or more established channel.
Suppose one creator has 100,000 subscribers while you have 1,000 subscribers. In this case, the larger creator holds more authority on the platform than you. So if you both went after a really competitive key term, the bigger channel would be more likely to rank for that keyword.
Yet, just because a YouTube channel has a smaller audience doesn’t mean keywords won’t work. You simply need to figure out which keywords are effective for your content.TubeBuddy Keyword Explorercan help.
How to do Effective Keyword Research for YouTube
Step #1: Use a Keyword Research Tool
Using a YouTube keyword research tool helps you identify popular search terms and phrases with high search volumes. These tools provide insights into competition levels, search trends, related keywords, and more, allowing creators to make data-driven decisions about their YouTube content strategy.

What is the Best Time to Post on YouTube? (2023 Update)

You want to capture the attention of your target audience when they are most active and receptive to consuming content.
Here’s the problem: if you post on YouTube at the wrong time, you risk missing out on peak viewership periods and decrease your chances of reaching your intended viewers and appearing in their recommended feeds.
This article will help solve this problem by discussing the best time to post on YouTube and helping you find your channel’s best time to post — withTubeBuddy.

Does YouTube Upload Date and Time Matter?
Yes… and knowing the best times to post on YouTube is key.
When a newly published video receives a significant number of initial views, likes, comments, and watch time within the first hour, it sends a positive signal to YouTube that the video isengaging to viewers. As a result, YouTube is more likely to recognize the video’s potential and promote it to a broader audience, including users who are not subscribed to the channel that posted it.
Uploading your videos when your target audience is most active is a logical strategy. Doing so increases the chances of immediate engagement and interaction from your existing subscribers and loyal viewers.
If your audience is active online and available to watch your content when published, you’re more likely to receive those initial views, likes, and comments that YouTube’s algorithm considers.
On the other hand, if you consistently publish video posts when your audience is less active, you might miss out on those initial engagement signals that could have boosted your video’s visibility. This can make it harder for your content to get traction and reach a wider audience.
What is the Best Time to Post a Video on Youtube?
The best time to post a video on YouTube is typically between 2 PM and 6 PM (EST) on weekdays, while on weekends, the ideal window is from 9 AM to 6 PM (EST).

Best Time to Upload on YouTube Depending on the Day of the Week
Here is an overview of the optimal timing for publishing on YouTube for each day of the week:
Remember: the suggested optimal posting times above may not work perfectly for everyone.The most suitable posting time for you will depend on where your audience is and their behavior. So, we recommend running your own experiments and collecting data specific to your channel.
That said, if your channel is new and doesn’t get a lot of viewers yet, it’s a good idea to use the suggested posting times mentioned above as a starting point.
DO THIS to DOUBLE YOUR VIEWS in 3 Minutes!
Best Time and Day to Post on YouTube by Channel Type
BENlabs AI (TubeBuddy is a BENlabs company) ran the numbers to determinethe best time to post on YouTubefor specific categories and content verticals. If you’re in thegaming,recipe/food, orparenting/familyniches, be sure to read that too.
What is the best day to post on YouTube in 2023?
The best days to post on YouTube are Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. As you approach the weekend, the content is known to perform better.
Here’s an interesting fact: When you post a video on social media platforms like Facebook, X / Twitter, or Instagram, it immediately appears in your followers’ feeds. But YouTube works differently.

How to Find Your Channel’s Best Time to Post on YouTube?
YouTube’s analytics section provides information about “When your viewers are on YouTube” (YouTube Studio > Analytics > Overview tab).
However, TubeBuddy AI goes a step further by analyzing your channel’s data in detail and generating a score for each hour of the week (which YouTube Analytics can’t).
Here’s how TubeBuddy users can access theBest Time to Publishfeature:

Our upload time recommendations consider time in six-hour blocks. The first hour is weighted the most, and the sixth hour is weighted the least. We figure most of your subscribers will view your high-quality content during this period, so you should publish and optimize around this timeframe.
You should post yourYouTubevideos 1-2 hours before the peak of your audience engagement. As you can see from the above snapshot, according to TubeBuddy, this particular channel’s best time to publish is 4AM. We recommend the creators post a new video between 2AM and 4AM, as this is prime engagement time for their content.

When is the Best Time to Live Stream on YouTube?
You can use the same TubeBuddy feature to find your audience’s optimal time for live streaming. TubeBuddy’s Livestream Time recommendations analyze two-hour intervals to identify when your audience is most engaged.
In the example below, 6AM is the clear winner for live streaming. So we can assume that this channel either deals in “rise and grind” content or its primary viewership is in a different time zone.

What is the Best Time to Post YouTube Shorts?
For better results, we recommend sharing your YouTube Shorts during weekdays, particularly on Mondays and Tuesdays when your target audience is most active. This will help you make the most of peak time activity.

Does YouTube Upload Date and Time Matter?
Yes… and knowing the best times to post on YouTube is key.
When a newly published video receives a significant number of initial views, likes, comments, and watch time within the first hour, it sends a positive signal to YouTube that the video isengaging to viewers. As a result, YouTube is more likely to recognize the video’s potential and promote it to a broader audience, including users who are not subscribed to the channel that posted it.
Uploading your videos when your target audience is most active is a logical strategy. Doing so increases the chances of immediate engagement and interaction from your existing subscribers and loyal viewers.
If your audience is active online and available to watch your content when published, you’re more likely to receive those initial views, likes, and comments that YouTube’s algorithm considers.
On the other hand, if you consistently publish video posts when your audience is less active, you might miss out on those initial engagement signals that could have boosted your video’s visibility. This can make it harder for your content to get traction and reach a wider audience.
What is the Best Time to Post a Video on Youtube?
The best time to post a video on YouTube is typically between 2 PM and 6 PM (EST) on weekdays, while on weekends, the ideal window is from 9 AM to 6 PM (EST).

How to Promote Your YouTube Channel on Instagram (2023 Update)
The question isn’t whether to promote your YouTube channel on Instagram, the question is how best to promote your YouTube channel on Instagram.
Instagram boasts over2 billion monthly active users, making it one of the most popular and effective platforms for business promotion.
Plus users spend an average of11.7 hoursa month on the platform, meaning there’s a good chance you can reach an active, engaged audience, drive them to your YouTube channel, and turn them into subscribers if you’re smart about how you promote YouTube on Instagram.
In this article, we’ll show you how to promote a YouTube channel on Instagram with seven practical tips.
7 Tips for Promoting Your YouTube Videos on Instagram
1. Manage your Instagram and YouTube profiles
If you plan to do serious Instagram marketing, your Instagram profile must look great. Users will check out your profile before heading to your YouTube channel, so it should be well-optimized and full of useful information.
Here’s how:
Here’s an example of Vic Berger’s (video creator) profile to demonstrate the points made above — a simple username, a clear profile picture, highlights sections, and a YouTube link to his channel.
The next stop is your YouTube profile. The YouTube profile of Vic Berger is also great to share here. The copy is simple and easy to follow.
So, you’ll need attractive and optimized YouTube and Instagram profiles to kickstart your promotion. After all, you want to showcase your expertise and valuable content that entices people to explore further.
2. Share teaser videos and photos on Instagram
If you’re into YouTube, you’ll know how important it is to share teasers regarding your upcoming videos and get folks pumped up. Instagram is the perfect place for that! Whether it’s a product launch or an event video, make a quick teaser and share it with your followers.
“The overwhelming majority of Instagram users are located outside of the United States,” says Erasto Kaseja, the head of international marketing research atPickWriters. “So it’s only natural that you should try to use the language of your followers once in a while to engage them.”
Producing content in various languages is especially common for YouTubers who go on tour, like Conan O’Brien.
3. Share behind-the-scenes content
Another way of promoting YouTube video on Instagram is through behind-the-scenes footage. Behind-the-scenes content and bloopers are fantastic for catching the eye, creating curiosity and hype. In other words, a great way to promote YouTube channel on Instagram.
Many followers want to know how their favorite YouTubers make their epic videos and what goes on behind-the-scenes.
Here’s the behind-the-scenes footage as Luca Vannella, an international hair designer, shares the process of transforming Chris Hemsworth into the iconic character of Thor.
When shooting behind-the-scenes content, we recommend you include the following tips. First, try to plan ahead. Before shooting, create a rough outline of what you want to capture. Identify key moments, interesting interactions, or essential equipment setups.
Second, it’s always a good idea to be unobtrusive. By that, we mean while capturing behind-the-scenes clips, try to blend into the background as much as possible. Don’t disrupt the natural flow of the process or distract the main subject.
4. Attract attention by using Instagram Stories
Did you know that a whopping86.6%of Instagram users post stories every single day? This stat is a gold mine for users or businesses looking to attract more subscribers and views to their YouTube channel using Instagram Stories.
Here are 10 ideas on how to use Instagram Stories for the promotion of your YouTube channel:
Cristine Rotenberg, a well-known YouTuber who runs a channel called Simply Nailogical, often uses stories to promote upcoming videos. For example, here’s one hilarious story where she shares the news of her new video.
5. Engage with your followers on Instagram
When promoting your YouTube channel on Instagram, remember it’s not a one-way gig. The key is to get interactive and build genuine connections with your audience.
Interacting means more than just dropping a simple “Thank you” in response to comments. While appreciation is key, take it up a notch — dive into their questions, ask them what kind of content they’re craving, and recommend other exciting videos.
You won’t believe how just one comment can boost content engagement. Keith Habersberger, a well-known YouTuber, rocks at responding to his followers’ comments. Check out the one below
If you want more followers and want to keep them engaged, show some love to your fans. Take a moment to reply to comments and let your followers know you appreciate their feedback.
6. Get started with Analytics
Promotions are great. But if you just promote without keeping an eye on how your Instagram marketing is doing, you’ll never really know if it’s doing any good for you.
You must measure the performance to see if all that effort is paying off. For example, check out the difference in views before and after an Instagram promotion to see if it’s actually bringing in more traffic.
While YouTube Analytics comes with some basic functionalities, other, more advanced tools can take your insights to the next level.
One of the best ways to access video viewing stats is with TubeBuddy, a free plugin that providesChannel Analytics. With TubeBuddy, you can gather more valuable information to better understand your audience and improve your content.
Using this Chrome extension, you can check performance stats, see analytics, and compare your channel’s popularity with competitors. Being able to compare your channel’s popularity with competitors helps you gauge your standing in the market and understand what strategies might be working for others.
So, with this data-driven approach, you can make more informed decisions on your YouTube content strategy, optimize your videos, and grow your subscription base more effectively.
7. Make use of Instagram Reels
Instagram Reels can also be a fantastic way to promote your YouTube channel and get more visibility.
Every day, Instagram users collectively spend17.6 million hourswatching Reels. Now, imagine tapping into that amount of attention. By sharing your YouTube content related Reels, you can catch the attention of these Instagram users. It’s like a sneak peek or a mini-trailer for your YouTube videos.
Instagram Reels are designed to be engaging, stopping Instagram users in their tracks as they scroll through their feeds.
You can use Reels to provide teasers or sneak peeks of your YouTube videos, creating excitement and curiosity among viewers. Including a clear call-to-action in your Reels encourages viewers to visit your YouTube channel for the full video.
Share your Reels across different parts of your Instagram profile to reach a wider audience and encourage others to share them too. Reels often generate more interactions like comments, likes, and shares, fostering a supportive community.
Incorporating Reels into your Instagram strategy can be a fun and effective way to promote your YouTube content and expand your viewership.

YouTube Monetization News: Make More Money from Your Content
In November 2023, YouTube is updating its monetization policies around ad formats, which is potentially excellent news for creators. Monetization on long-form videos and live streams will also be different, and how much money you make from your videos, yeah, that’s going to be different too.
What are these changes exactly? Read more or watch our fact-filled video on the news:
YouTube Monetization Update: November 2023
Long-form videos:At the moment, if you go to turn on monetization on a long-form video, you have control over which ad formats show, like pre-roll, post-roll, skippable, and non-skippable ads.Starting in November, YouTube is removing these individual controls. Instead, when creators choose to turn on monetization, their viewers may see any of these ad formats that YouTube deems most appropriate.
This should make monetizing your videos a lot easier.
No more trying to figure out which ad formats to turn on or off or where to place them. Instead, you just toggle it all on or all off with the click of a button. YouTube will handle it all for you in a very intelligent way by using the information they have on each viewer to decide which ad format is most appropriate. So if a specific ad type is likely to push a viewer away, YouTube won’t show it, but if the ad is likely not to bother that specific viewer, YouTube will show it. It’s all based on internal data that YouTube has on the ad tolerance level of each individual viewer. This approachshouldhelp you to make more money.
According to YouTube’s data, creators who had non-skippable ads enabled in combination with other ad formats saw an average of over 5% greater YouTube ad revenue at the cost of less than a 1% decrease in watch time compared to creators who did not. In that same experiment, creators who had pre-roll ads enabled in combination with other ad formats saw an average of over 15% greater YouTube ad revenue only at the cost of less than a 5% decrease inwatch timecompared to creators who did not.
Live streams:YouTube is also introducing new options for live stream ads. When this update rolls out, creators will have the opportunity to select the frequency of mid-roll ads in intervals of 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30 minutes. You can also choose to have YouTube display them when they feel is best, and if you decide to let YouTube decide for you, you can fine-tune things by selecting from conservative, balanced, or aggressive ad frequencies.
While streaming, you’ll see a 60-second countdown before the ad plays and have the option to skip it or delay it. If you need to step away for a moment, maybe to grab a drink or address a technical issue, you’ll soon be able to use the “Insert Ads” button to insert a mid-roll anytime you want manually.
These are big updates. Overall, we like these changes because they have the potential to help you as a creator make more money from your content than ever before!

But as any successful creator will know, there are certain guidelines you need to follow, or your budding career will never get off the ground. The TubeBuddy blog, plus ourYouTubeand social channels are chockful of tips and advice on how to kickstart a killer content strategy and avoid the pitfalls that catch out more unsuspecting creators. Our latest live stream takes a deep dive into the mistakes you can easily avoid on your journey. Click below for the full experience, or read the transcript below.
We’ve pulled out some of the key fails new or smaller, creators often make, which stop them from reaching their full potential. If this might be you then now is a great time to correct them.
#1 Stop Failing to Take Your Content Seriously
Many content creators wait for some kind of validation or success before they take content strategy seriously. Unfortunately, a lot of those content creators will end up giving up. Because they’re not taking it as seriously as they should, they don’t get that response that they’re after. We encourage you to shift that mindset if you want serious results. If I take things seriously now, then that’s actually how you end up getting the real results. That’s how you end up building a brand on YouTube. That’s how you end up getting more views on your content. That’s how you end up getting subscribers on your channel. Because you’re being intentional about everything.
#2 Don’t Leave Titles and Thumbnails to the Last Minute
If you want to grow Your YouTube Channel, you should understand thatcustom thumbnails and your titlesneed to work together to complement each other. One grabs a viewer’s attention, the other one encourages them to click play. So make sure that you’re always thinking about that before you make your video content so that you can match the expectations that people have. Team thumbnails and titles together to win the click and grow your YouTube channel.
#3 Not Connecting with YOUR Audience at Every Opportunity
It’s very tempting to mimic another creator to replicate their success. However, all that ends up happening is you become a poor copy of that person instead of being the best version of yourself. At the end of the day, what you want to make sure that you’re doing is that you’re making yourself connectable to the people thatyouare interacting with your content. Constantly imitating another creator is just going to lead to a dull channel and possible creator burnout.
#4 Failing To Do Any Research on Content Your Viewers Want
One of the hardest things for a creator who wants to grow on YouTube is to separate themselves from other people who are doing the same type of content. Only by understanding what you can uniquely bring to the space that nobody else is can help you stand out.
When it comes to the research side of things, you have to make sure that you are looking into topics that your audience is interested in. If you are not doing that research, then you are just making videos that you just want to make. That’s a great way to keep your view, and subscriber counts low. Take full advantage of TubeBuddy, Google Trends, YouTube Analytics, and other data sources to identify which interests and topics viewers are searching for and engaging with.
#5 Neglecting to Keep Your Skills Up to Date
The next big mistake creators make is not being in a constant state of skilled development. If you really want to thrive on YouTube, it’s essential to make sure that you are up to date with a range of skills or developing new ones.
Get good at copywriting because this will help with scriptwriting, as well as titles and descriptions. Learn how to design so you can make better thumbnails and better video graphics. Learn the art of videography and editing for obvious reasons. Develop your skills and experience in public speaking, charisma, psychology, marketing, and other fields to give you a heads-up on other creators.
#6 Not Playing the YouTube Game
Yes, when it comes to your content, you can have fun and take chances but if you don’t play by the phenomenally strict YouTube rules and guidelines you are risking too much. If you need a reminder onYouTube’s Community GuidelinesandTerms of Service, click on the links provided. Please don’t be that one creator that effs around and finds out.

STOP Making These Mistakes If You Want To Grow Your YouTube Channel: Transcript
If your YouTube content creator and you are having trouble getting the ball rolling, if you’re new to YouTube, if you have a small YouTube channel, no matter what it is that you seem to do, you just can’t break through today, we’re going to be talking about the main mistakes that content creators make that happen.
So if you are trying to overcome the lack of views that you’re currently getting on your YouTube channel and just the lack of activity, lack of comments, the lack of engagement, and all of that, then you’re definitely going to want to make sure that you tune into this. It’s usually because of a handful of core things that we are going to be talking about here during the stream today. There’s a nice list that I have here in front of me, but I’m going to focus on 10 to 12 different things that are the biggest mistakes that people make when it comes to YouTube.
Creator Mindset
So we’re going to go ahead and get started right now with the very first thing, which is themindset of a content creator.So, as content creators, we often have this thought in our mind when we’re first getting started to where we’ll think to ourselves, hey, I’m just going to kind of do what I need to do; maybe I’m going to, you know, put in, you know, some good effort with this and If things start going well on my YouTube channel, that is when I’m going to double down, that’s when I’m going to start really taking this seriously. That’s when I’m going to start really working on my skill sets and doing all the things that I need to do. Once a video starts getting traction, I start getting some attention to my YouTube channel. This particular thing, even though It seems trivial, but it can be a huge roadblock for a lot of content creators. And the reason for that is that if you are publishing content with the hopes of something doing well, then you start to take it seriously. So the fix for this is you want to switch things around and switch your perspective. So if you are somebody that wants to take this seriously and you want to turn this into something that you can do full time or maybe a side hustle, or you want to use it to get your message out, or just to bring, you know, some attention to yourself in that particular case, you have to change how you’re thinking about the approach.
What usually happens is when content creators come in, and they’re not focused on taking it seriously 1st, and they’re waiting for things to happen before they take it seriously. Then a lot of those content creators will end up stopping, or they’ll end up not getting traction and putting in all of this effort and all of this work and making videos. But because they’re not taking it as seriously as they should, they don’t get that response that they’re after. So because of that, I encourage you to fix this first one. I encourage you to shift that mindset if I want serious results. If I take things seriously now, then that’s actually how you end up getting the serious results. That’s how you end up building a brand on YouTube. That’s how you end up getting more views on your content. That’s how you end up getting subscribers on your channel. Because you’re being intentional about everything, it is what you’re doing because you are taking it seriously. You are looking at it for the opportunity that it is on YouTube.
Grow Your YouTube Channel:Titles and Thumbnails
Next up is not considering your titles and thumbnails before you make your videos. How many people here will make your video, and then once your video is done, you’re like, OK, how am I going to do the title and thumbnail?
If you’re one of those people, you’re actually working against yourself in that in that sense. But if you really want to thrive here on YouTube, the best thing you can do when it comes to your workflow is to think about the title and the thumbnail for your video before you ever make the content. Before you even consider actually hitting the record button. And the reason for that is that you might have an amazing idea for a piece of video content, but if you can’t package it correctly through the thumbnail in the title, then people aren’t going to see it. Really think about your idea; think about how I am going to illustrate this idea from the outside when somebody hasn’t had the chance to or the opportunity to watch my video yet when it’s just being presented to them on a home page. Or, you know, recommended next to another video or under another video. What am I going to do in my thumbnail title to one, help the viewer recognize that this content is something that they might care about, and two, by leveraging the title, compel them to click on this and the reason it’s so important to do this first and I know.
Not every content type you know can leverage this, but if your content type does support this, definitely do it. And here’s why: because a lot of people can get high click-through rates on their videos or on their thumbnails. But then, as soon as somebody hits the content, people end up bailing on the content. Or they just can’t get people to click on the videos, even though the content itself is good. So the problem is if you don’t think of your thumbnail and title first before you make your videos, what’s going to happen is you’re going to have to shoehorn your thumbnail and title around the video that you’ve already created, which means maybe your intro isn’t going to be a perfect match for your thumbnail and title. Maybe the way that you’re setting up the rest of the video isn’t going to be a great match for what the viewers are expecting when they come into the content. So because of that, you want to start thinking about when you come up with the video idea, OK, before I make this. How am I going to present this to people? I want you to think about is if I’m going to be presenting this to people from the outside. What type of expectation is this going to create for the viewer?
OK. So this puts this big question right there in your face. You know the content creator. And then from there, once you have that and you sketch out some ideas, you don’t have to build the thumbnail. But if you sketch out ideas like, OK, well, I’m going to have, you know, a 2-panel thumbnail. And on this side, I’m going to have this. And then, on this side, I’m going to show this. That’s going to ensure that you get the right footage and everything you need, the right shots that you need for it. But more importantly, it’s also going to ensure that when somebody sees that thumbnail and title, and they’re like, Oh yeah, this is definitely something that, you know, that I might be interested in, that they’re going to click into it. And then, when they come into the video content itself, they’re going to end up watching for a longer period of time.
And we all knowhow important watch timeis, so they’re going to end up watching for a longer period of time because you are going to be able to meet their expectations as they come into the video because you’re going to already know through your pre-planning of the thumbnail and the title, what that viewer is going to expect, or your intention for what it is that they’re going to expect when they come into the content, because of that. You want to make sure you’re always thinking about your thumbnail title before you actually make the content itself. And again, you don’t have to build it like you have to open up Photoshop or whatever it is you make your own. Thumbnails in and actually put everything together, but. If you have, if you have a tablet, sketch it out. If you have a, you know, notepad, you know, just grab a pencil and just sketch out some general ideas of what you think it’s going to be.
And as a part of that, also think about how your thumbnail and your titles work together to complement each other. One of the things that YouTube says is that your thumbnails and titles work together as a team to win the click. Because one grabs their attention, the other one pulls them through. So make sure that you’re always thinking about that before you make your video content so that you can match the expectations that people have.
Connect with Your Audienceto Grow Your YouTube Channel
One of the things with YouTube is that it’s about you, the content creator, right? So of course, you know, viewers are coming on, they want to watch content, they want to learn stuff, they want to be entertained, they want to be motivated, they want to, you know, be challenged with the way that they think or they want to jump into their echo chambers or whatever it is. But at the end of the day, what you want to make sure that you’re doing is that you’re making yourself connectable to the people that you are interacting with your content.
So here’s how you do that. So a lot of people will act like other content creators because, you know before they start their YouTube channels, a lot of new creators before they start their channels, they’ll see other content creators acting a certain way or doing certain things. No. Like, hey, I like this content creator, so therefore, I’m just going to mimic that content creator instead of just being myself. I’m going to try to be that person, right? And what ends up happening is you end up being a bad copy of that person instead of being the best version of yourself that is on camera. So instead of people connecting with you, they’re connecting with this, this persona of you that is based on someone else. And here’s a really bad thing about that, even if it starts working, and I’ve. I’ve actually known and worked with creators who have run into this situation. Even when it starts working, you are, in terms of your channel, doing better. If you take that path, you’re going to hit a point to where you’re going to be like, man, people aren’t even like coming here for me, right? They’re not even coming here like, you know, the person they’re interacting with, it’s not even me.
Right. And that can cause a lot of weird things to go on in your head. And then, eventually, you’ll burn out on trying to be that person. And then you’re going to deliver yourself to that audience, and they’ll be like, oh, they completely change. They’re doing something different now. They’re acting like a different person now. Like, what’s going on, and you’re going to give them a different experience.
So if you can start and be as much of yourself as you possibly can and leverage that uniqueness that we all have in that particular case, you’re going to be something that people can connect to at a deeper level; you’ll be able to sustain that over a long period of time, which is important if you’re somebody wants to do this for a long period of time.
Another thing as well is, you know, when you do start letting people know the nuances of your personality, the things that you like, the things that you don’t like, you know type of, you know, the person that you are the type of people that you like, you know. Are you a positive person? It’s usually from my other shot, but like, you know, personality items like, I’ve got some Star Wars stuff laying around, I’ve got VR headsets lying around, you know things. Like that, and some of those things are like just because it’s a good place to put it. But it’s also because I’m like, OK, well, somebody watches my videos, and they’re into Star Wars as an example. And I have my Stormtrooper helmet over here, my Stormtrooper Lego set thing over here. Then in that particular case, when people see that that are in the Star Wars right there, there’s that connection, right? Like, there’s something that we agree on, even if you don’t agree with everything that I’m saying and all that, and there’s something else. That we agree on that you know that we’re alike and. In some way same exact thing with the VR headsets or anything that you’re into. Also, that’s why you see a lot of content creators where they have like bookshelves, and you know all of these things in the background of all these different personality items or just shelves in general with all these personality items because one, it’s a display and it is a set in some cases. But also it gives people things to connect with things to relate to.
So because of that, make sure that you are always just giving yourself and that you are sharing those things that you are interested in; a great medium for this is. Live streaming and the reason that live streaming is great is because while you’re live streaming, you can kind of sidebar things and talk about, you know, little aspects. Just briefly talk about other things that you care about, about ways that you think about things, and all that that you may or may not insert into your video content. Currently, because live streams are just a little bit more, you know, relaxed and you know, and all of that stuff, and they’re not perfectly polished and all of that, which helps your personality come through, which is fantastic.
Do the Research!
Another huge problem that causes that is a lack of research. A lot of content creators will only study other content creators and their niche. I mean, it’s good to pay attention, and it’s good to pay attention to what videos they’re putting out, what’s working and not working on their channels, and things like that because you’re trying to tap into the same people. But if you’re only researching the people that are in your space and you’re digging into how they are operating, then it kind of keeps you in this little box in this little bubble to where it doesn’t leave a lot of room for growth. And a lot of room for ideas.
Even if you love something and then you start doing it, then somebody else in your space is doing it, then it’s like, Oh well, you know, I was doing that first, and then they kind of took this idea. And then they started doing it. But if you see another creator in a completely different type of content, you know, doing something like, wow, I love how they did that particular thing with their graphics, or I love how they, you know. Started their video with that, or I love these little pattern interrupts that they do and how they, you know, do these little things like that. I love their use of music from transitioning from, you know, scene to scene or topic to topic and things like that. When you start noticing those types of things on other types of content, it can create a lot of inspiration for you.
And it can break you out of the box of your niche because one of the hardest things on YouTube is separating yourself from the other people that are doing the same type of content you are. You know, like if you’re a gamer, for example, there’s a billion gamers on YouTube. What are you doing to separate yourself from everybody else? Right, of course. Hopefully, you’re being the, you know, best version of yourself as you can possibly be. But you should also be trying to think of what is something new that I could introduce into this based on some of this research that I’m doing of some of these other, you know, amazing content creators on the platform.
Like, what are some, you know, things that I can bring into our space that nobody else is currently bringing into our space? And by doing that, that’s going to help you stand out. Because as creatives right this is what we do. We’re like, hey, I want to make this, and then we get to work making it. But if you want to get the ball rolling faster, if you’re stuck in that period of, like, man, I just can’t get things moving, then in that particular case, you.
When it comes to the research side of things, you have to make sure that you know you are looking into topics that your audience is interested in. If you are, you know, not doing that research, then you can be making the videos that you just want to make, which is. Hey, but if you’re stuck in that box, and you’re trying to break out of that box because you keep hitting these ceilings with your view counts, the big problem and the big mistake that you could be making is not doing that research. And because of that, you create this ceiling to where there’s not a huge market for exactly what it is that you’re making topically. So because of that, when you start doing research, and you can use TubeBuddy for this, you can use their keyword explorer. You can use Google Trends for this, but the idea is just to start looking around and trying to get a pulse.
If I make this video based on this topic, what is the potential reach that I might be able to have? Because if you just make something, then in that particular case, if it’s something really unique and crazy, then in that particular case, yeah, I mean it, it might take off, but if you know going into it and you’re intentional, and you know, Hey, I’ve done the research on this, I know. That X amount of people are looking for this information based on other channels that are making similar content. Then, you know, when they publish videos that are similar to this, they end up, you know, doing good views and things like that. It just proves the potential for the video so that when you are publishing the content, you’re not thinking to yourself, this video isn’t doing well because it’s not because people aren’t interested in it. Maybe it’s because of how people are responding to the video maybe. I’m not able to get people to click because I’ve proven already before I even made the content.
So you just want to make sure that you are doing that leg work, so to speak, and making sure that you’re giving yourself that opportunity to. One trick that a lot of content creators use, or one you know, a tip that you’ll hear a lot, is to, you know, pick a very, you know, knit specific subject that’s great and that’s good advice.
But if you only make content that is just super isolated and super niche, then you’re just limiting your potential. But if you’re like, hey, as part of my content strategy. And for those of you who are not familiar with content strategy, it’s basically planning out your content over a short or long period of time and giving purpose to each individual piece of content in order to fulfill goals that you have for your channel or your business, or you know whatever it is that you’re making content for. So when you’re putting your content strategy together, you can say, hey, I’m going to cover these niche topics because. Not a lot of people are covering them, and that’s going to give me a bunch of leaves on the branches, too. But then I’m also going to try to go after the trunk, right? I’m going to try to actually go after the main core part of the tree here, where most of the viewership is on YouTube, and I’m going to try to tap into that as well. So, just kind of mixing in some broader topics within your niche so that you can give yourself that potential to kind of breakthrough that ceiling that you’re currently hitting.
Another part when it comes to, you know, research is you also want to make sure that you are a student of the platform. I kind of touched on this briefly a second ago, but you want to make sure that you are looking at your content type and other creators in your niche, and you also want to make sure that you are just hopping into YouTube search and seeing what pops up in YouTube search and just watching some cooking videos and seeing what they’re doing for the high performing cooking videos like how are they keep people engaged. How are they starting their videos? What kind of structure are they doing with what it is that they’re doing? Go look at, you know, if you’re not a gamer, go watch some gaming videos that might, you know, inspire you because they do some really cool stuff in the gaming space. If you are making videos about fashion, then in that particular case, watching videos on tech. You know, even though it’s not related to fashion, watching videos on tech, you could see something that the tech folks are doing that could inspire you with your content and vice versa as well.
So, becoming a student of YouTube, watching content that’s outside of your space, not as a viewer. But as somebody that’s studying that content can also be a way to give you new ideas and kind of freshen up your perspective and also be able to pull some of that, you know, type of stuff into your content. But most importantly though, you know outside of that part is just making sure that you are looking into the potential reach that you have with every video that you publish. If you’re trying to break out of that. You know, the box that you’re currently locked into next problem, and this is this is huge on YouTube. I’m guilty of this. Every content creator is guilty of this until they hit a threshold, and then they’re like, ah, you know what, it’s actually not as good as I thought it was. And that is thinking your videos are amazing.
So don’t be offended by this, but here’s here’s how this works. So when we are coming up with ideas for our videos, we’re thinking to ourselves, like, yeah, this is a good idea. People are going to like this, then we go, and we start making the content itself, and we put everything together, and we edit it, and we share the information that we think is good, and we share, you know, the experiences. I should say that we. That’s good. And then we edit those videos in the way that we like, and we use the music that we like, and we use the graphics that we like, and we use the pacing that we like, and we do everything based on our tastes. Well, in some cases, that’s a perfect match for how other people are interacting or how other people appreciate content. And in some cases, it’s the opposite of how other people respond to content.
I hang out in YouTuber communities on Facebook and Discord and on Reddit as well, and one of the things I constantly see is new content creators saying things like my videos are great. I don’t understand why people are not interacting with my content, but they’re interacting with this. This other channel doesn’t seem to put a lot of effort into what it is. That they’re doing. Right. The problem there is not that the content is great, and it’s not getting a response. The problem there is the creator is biased toward their own content, and it’s clouding their vision of why people are not responding to what it is that they’re doing compared to what it is that other people are doing. Right.
So if you’re trying to grow at scale and you’re trying to break out of that box, you have to make sure that you’re open to the idea. that your content is just like mine, just like everybody else that’s hanging out here, just like everybody else on YouTube. Our content might need some improvement, right? And you have to embrace that idea because if you right now, you know, especially you’re getting started, if you right now you’re like, hey, this stuff is amazing and it might, it might be, but if people aren’t responding to it like it’s amazing, then that means other people don’t find it as amazing as you do. Therefore, you have to use the analytics that YouTube gives us to better understand how people at scale are responding to what it is that you’re doing and then make adjustments as necessary.
Some of the things that you want to look for are your audience retention report and a second-by-second graph of how people are responding to our content. On average, over time. So what you can look forward, you looking for places in your videos where you get spikes where people are rewinding or rewatching parts of your videos or people are sharing it out. And that’s an entry point. You can also see places in your video where people dip out. And those are problem areas because you’re causing people to leave. Another thing is that inside of your audience retention report, you also have from the drop-down if you’re on a computer, you have relative audience retention. So relative audience retention, which has been renamed to how your videos compared to other videos on YouTube or compared to other videos, is the language they use. But when you use that drop-down, that gives you real insights to how you’re comparing against other videos of similar length on the platform. So it just gives you insights. So it gives you stuff, it gives you information so you can know what it is that you need to work on. And then from there, you’re like, hey, you know what? My videos are actually compared to other videos. They’re not that bad. I’m pretty good at keeping people consistent.
Part of that is you have to look at your ability to get people to click, and then you have to look at your ability to get people to continue watching other videos on YouTube. So when it comes to getting people to click, YouTube shows us what’s called our click-through rate and what your click-through rate is on YouTube. It shows your video to people on the platform. That’s called an impression. That’s what. That’s what it’s called in your YouTube analytics. So your click-through rate is for every impression that YouTube shows, you know, every time YouTube shows your videos to people on the platform, how many of those people convert into an actual viewer, somebody that clicked on.
So the average is on YouTube, just so you know between 2 and 10%. YouTube does not give us impression data for that. They just tell us that the average. On YouTube is between 2 and 10%. So what you need to do overtime is you need to figure out what the averages are in your channel and then start mapping your click-through rate against that. So if you notice, hey, I’m coming in pretty low here, then you know to make a change. Of some kind.
You want to make sure that you are looking at your audience retention reports and that you’re seeing what is happening at the end of your videos. This is really important because a huge mistake that a lot of new content creators make, and it’s just because they see other people going on YouTube.
Go into the top right-hand corner of your analytics for an individual video or at the channel level, There’s an advanced mode so you can click on that and it takes you into like a whole other area of advanced analytics and you can get all kinds of amazing information in there. But one of the things that you can do is once you’re on that page, you’re going to see a navigation tab for traffic sources. When you click on that. On an individual video level, you’re going to see what your click-through rate and average view duration look like coming from home page viewers. What does it look like coming from suggested video viewers? What does it look like coming from search viewers? And based on what you’re trying to accomplish with your channel and the goals that you’re trying to, you know, achieve in viewership or whatever it is that you’re doing channel for, then you know that information can ensure that you’re taking the right approach there.
In fact, if you’re using TubeBuddy’s AB testing tool, it gives you some of that information to make it easier to understand where you can upload two different thumbnails, and it’ll compare them back and forth against each other. And it’ll tell you, like, hey, on home pages, this one does the better search. This one does better-suggested videos. This one does better, and then that way, based on what it is that you or where it is that you’re trying to get traffic from it, it tells you how competitive you are there.
Keeping Your Skills Up to Date
The next big mistake is not being in a constant state of skilled development as a content creator. So look, I know that a lot of people have jobs and schools and families. I mean, I would say everyone has other things that they do outside of YouTube. Most people, not everybody. But you know, people have, you know, things that they do outside of YouTube. So because of that, you know, life is just busy. However, if you really want to thrive on YouTube, it’s really important to make sure that you are in a constant state of skill development, and the reason for that is that this stuff is hard. You’re competing against some very talented people, and it doesn’t matter what niche you’re in; there are people in the niche who are talented. You might be one of those. Some of it is learned talent, where people have over a period of time they’ve learned how to do things better than most people, which is why they get the the results that they do. So because of that, you want to be in a constant state of skill development.
Make sure that you’re, you’re studying content around writing titles copywriting because that’s, you know, also title-related, design so you can make better thumbnails and make better video graphics. You can take your videos from looking janky to looking nice and polished because you know you learned how to do it. Videography, because you know, there’s there’s rules and concepts to all these things, like framing. And, you know, all of that. You also need to make sure that you are, you know, consuming content and practicing around public speaking, charisma, psychology, marketing, editing, using all the different you know tools that you have available.
You have to learn how to communicate effectively, you have to learn how to grab people’s attention through imagery and through text. You have to learn how you know concepts of editing so that you can, you know, make sure that you keep people engaged and watching the content. When you’re editing, that’s more of a verb, right? Like you’re actively intentionally trying to bring people through the content based on what it is that you are sharing with them. And based on how it is that you’re that you’re structuring everything through the content. And based on the different choices that you’re making. And as you go through the content, there’s a YouTube channel that everybody here should watch, Hayden Hellier Smith. He edits for, like, Logan Paul and some other big creators. If you watch one of his videos, it’s going to blow your mind. going to like, oh, wow. Never even thought about that stuff. And it’s because he’s a professional editor. Like, that’s what he does. And he does it, you know, at a very high level. So that’s what he studies.
When it comes to skill development, if you want to do better, you know at the thing of YouTube, then you have to be better at the thing of YouTube. And the only way to fulfill that is by working on yourself and developing the skill sets needed. His name is Hayden Hellier. Smith, if you just type in, start typing in like Hayden Hellier Smith or even if Hayden Smith maybe that it that might get him to come up in YouTube search. But yeah, just incredible in terms of just you know concepts that he shares, and if you just pay attention to the nuance of how he explains things that can really give you a lot of insights into what goes into editing.
Keep Experimenting
It’s easy for us to get kind of stuck in our ways. And as you start getting more and more successful on the platform. Because you’ll be like, hey, this is working. I’m going to do it forever. Right. But people change the platform changes. You know, competition comes into the space like all kinds of different things happen that can impact you as an individual channel and an individual creator. So because of that, you should always, even if, even if you’re like, hey. I’m going to do just let’s play this on my channel, and that’s all I’m going to do. If you’re not getting the results, doing that experiment with something else, keep doing that. But experiment with doing something else. Because maybe you are good. Maybe you’re good, you know, at playing the game.
Maybe you’re entertaining to watch, but maybe you’re an amazing teacher. And when it comes to showing people how to, you know, navigate in certain parts of the game and put content together in a way that teaches people how to do something, maybe you’re maybe you’re, like, the best. In the gaming niche at that. But you haven’t given it a chance yet because you’re stuck over here doing, doing let’s play is because that’s what you think you should be doing, right? So because of that, just make sure that you’re open to experimenting. Like, you know, right now on my on my YouTube channel. So I have always run an experiment, so I just came off of a year of doing weekly news on my YouTube channel.. When I was first doing it, a lot of people were coming back. I was getting a lot of return viewers, but because the news wasn’t really that big, even though it added a decent amount of subscribers to my channel, it added about $10,000 a year. You know, to the to the ad revenue.
The channel, even though those things happened after a while, it’s like, well, the news isn’t that impactful. It’s just kind of like little nuanced updates here and there, maybe some industry news things like that. And at scale, people who are watching my videos just don’t care as much about that. So because of that, once the novelty wore off, the things that I was talking about weren’t as big of a deal. Then you know the news started becoming less and less important. So now. That experiment is over. It was working for a while, so now what I’m doing is I’m not doing the weekly news anymore, and instead, I’m waiting for news that is impactful.
So it’s like, you know, hey is what, what’s you know, is there something major that’s happening right now? And then I’ll talk about, you know, I’ll talk about that, you know, for example, like, you know, the shorts adding the, you know, links right there. On the page where we can direct people to any video that’s gigantic, right? Same thing with them taking the links out of YouTube shorts. Gigantic, you know, news. So because of that, you know, I made sure to make a video about it. But on the experimental side, now I’m like, hey, AI’s coming around. So let’s go ahead and mix trends with, you know, something that’s trending with, you know, with an experimental bucket. And then, with that, what a bucket is. It’s basically like a set of videos, right? It’s like a series or a type of content that you make compared to the other. Videos that you may. Right, so now I’m experimenting with, you know, AI content. So, I’ve got a couple of AI shorts. I’ve got an AI video, and then I’m getting ready to publish another one tomorrow on my channel. That’s an AI video. And out of those, you know, I’ll, I’ll do them until people, you know, start falling off of those as well. But the whole idea is. If what you’re doing isn’t working, experiment because you know, again, you could be amazing. You know, creator at this thing right here, but you could be OK at this thing over here, right?
So just always experimenting to give yourself that, you know, stimulus, so to speak. And just to see if you, you know, if you’re better suited for another aspect of what it is that you’re. The next one, and I get some blowback when I talk about this one, so I’m ready for it. If you want to, you know, kind of roast me up here in the comments. It’s perfectly OK. So what I’m talking about is basically breaking out-of-the-box if somebody’s having trouble, you know, getting more views on your content, and you’re somebody that is, you know, trying to figure out how to navigate all this stuff and talk about the mistakes that content creators typically make that.
That keeps them from growing, but the next one is monetization. So part of growing as a content creator is having money to be able to do all of the things you know as a content creator to get equipment to pay for services like, you know, TubeBuddy to go to conferences like VidSummit to, you know, get the right camera gear to be able to fly places if you want to, to do collaborations, if that’s something that you’re interested in. All of those things, you know, they make money. So because of that, the general rule of thumb people are like, oh, yeah, don’t monetize until you get at least 10,000 subscribers on your YouTube channel and things like that, I totally agree. we’ve got Jill’s comfort zone in the house. And we have Gusman in the house right now. And out of those people that I just mentioned and everybody else here, your next video could be the video that puts you on the map. And if you have a video that you publish and that video starts going nuts in terms of, like, you’re getting a really high response on it. So YouTube showing it to everybody.
Get Real About MonetizationWhen You Aim Grow Your YouTube Channel:
Start thinking about monetization as fast as you possibly can because of how YouTube works If you have a video pop off and you have a video that just starts thriving, then what’s going to happen is the people that are interacting with that video, YouTube is going to detect that they’re enjoying that content. So YouTube is going to say, hey, people are liking this content. So what else on this channel is a good fit for this person? And then YouTube’s going to start recommending some of your old content to them. And if you don’t have some of these monetization things in place, then what’s going to happen is that originating video that, you know, kind of blew your channel up, you’re going to miss the opportunity there and you’re going to miss it on all of the videos down the line where you can just simply have descriptions in your links. You don’t even have to be on reviews or anything. You can just have links in your description. That leads people into, you know, additional things, and in your videos you just simply mentioned, hey, got links in the description or, you know whatever.
So you know, missing out on those opportunities is definitely something that you do not want to do. And Monique says I got two more affiliates. So I need to update my description templates. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Get them in.
Stick to the YouTube Rules
So next up on the list. Is not knowing the game that you’re playing. So like I mentioned before, I’m in all the YouTube community, so I’m in the communities, on Reddit and on Facebook and Discord like this is how I like. Stay sharp, you know, in terms of like knowing. What it is? That you guys want. OK, so because of that, one of the things that I see a lot is people going into Reddit or Facebook. Group and like, oh man, YouTube. Deleted my channel for no. Man, I got a copyright strike. I don’t know what’s going on. I just use 5 seconds of that song and people are making all these complaints. But the reason that you know, channels get taken down is because people violate their rules. It’s not that YouTube is like, oh, hey, this channel right here, let’s just take them down. Like it doesn’t work that way.
The reason channels get taken down is because the creators are violating the rules. So if you want to do this as a content creator for an extended period of time and you don’t want to run the risk of, you know, losing everything once you do get out of that you know box and you can get more views in your content then make sure that you are keeping up the rules. So YouTube has terms of service. Take an afternoon to read through it. You don’t have to memorize it. Just read through it and consider the type of content that you’re publishing and consider you know the things that you’re going on. Platform. They have community guidelines, the same exact thing. Make sure you take an afternoon, and you read through them. And again, you don’t have to remember everything.
You just have to think, OK, with the content that I’m putting out, how does this apply to me and are there any lines that I’m, you know, kind of any roles that I’m in the Gray area of or is there anything that I’m doing that could come back to bite me? In the future, I had a situation. So one of the first videos I put out on my channel was a video about how to download a thumbnail from YouTube. So I put out this video before we had the option to just download from inside of the Creator studio and one of the things for that video, I mean, this is my fault because I didn’t know the rules, but one of the things in that video. Is as I start the video right I pop up like this. I’m like and I’m wearing a ski mask and I have the, you know, scene and everything where it looks like it’s dark. So I have like cricket sound effects going on in the background. Like I’m going to show you how to steal any thumbnail off of YouTube, but then once we get into the video itself cuz that was just part of the hook. But once we got into the video itself, I’m like, hey, you know, images are copyright protected, blah blah. So you don’t want to take other people. ‘S thumbnails but. If you need to use your thumbnail for some reason, this is how you get it, and I showed people how to go into the code on a web page. And find the thumbnail and then copy it out and then save it to their computer in case they want to use it in a video or something. Well, because I didn’t know the rules years later, like two years later, YouTube gave me a copyright or a community guideline strike because I was showing people, even though at that time they had the option where you could download thumbnails directly. I was showing people how to circumvent YouTube, you know systems in order to get that thumbnail. So fortunately I was able to get everything you know, you know, fixed up with that to where it wasn’t a big deal video got reinstated. I still deleted it because I was like. Yeah, I don’t. I’m not. You know, I don’t want to have that.
But the thing I’m trying to express though is like you got to know, you got to know the rules of the game that you’re playing, because if not, you can create something amazing and you can start to get the results that you want. And then one either some, you know, hate or some jerk is going to use it against you and report you or something like that, or you’re just going to end up getting caught up in the system where, you know, everything is automated and all that, and you’re going to go through some long process of trying to dispute it. Or like some of the people I see on Reddit and Facebook, you might end up in one of those situations where you lose it all just because you didn’t know the rules of the game, right? So make sure that you make sure you figure that out. Or make sure you pay attention to that. And another thing that’s really important and this one isn’t necessarily going to break you out-of-the-box, but this one is something that you need to make sure that you’re thinking about. For those of you that are wanted to do this for a long period of time, make sure that when it comes to uploading your content, you’re thinking of consistency not from the aspect of I need to. Make sure I’m publishing videos every. So often to YouTube, but I need to work on the process of ideation and creation and publishing of my content into my lifestyle.
File so that every week I’m taking very specific actions to ensure that I get content up so that I can continue publishing videos in my live stream just last week. So I do a live stream on my main channel where I answer questions for 3 hours straight, and I have a form. You know the people fill in the information there, and somebody you know left the question like hey, I don’t know what’s going on. I’m publishing videos to my channel, but my channel is not growing. I’m going to look at the channel, and the person will publish for like one week, and then they won’t publish again for two months, and then they’ll go, and they’ll publish for, you know, maybe one or two other videos and they won’t publish it. For a few months, they’re just not giving themselves a chance on YouTube because they’re not staying recent in viewer histories, which is something that’s important. But they’re also just not working.
The process of creating content in their lifestyle and it’s causing them to be inconsistent on the platform and inconsistent with the process and their lifestyle, which makes the whole thing unsustainable. So if you are somebody that that is like, hey, I want to turn this into something I want to, you know, take it seriously. Then in that particular case, make sure you work on that side of consistency, right? And it’s going to result in you publishing content on a regular basis at a consistent pace, but you just want to make sure that you’re working that process. Of ideation, creating, and publishing the content into your regular life cycle and your regular lifestyle. And of course, be patient because you know expectations. A lot of people will come in, they’ll see these videos on TikTok and on YouTube, where they’re like. I started a YouTube channel, and within the last 10 days, I got 10,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel. Yeah, that’s great. But if you watch those videos, you can tell if you know, if you’re experienced, you can tell when you’re watching those videos.

But as any successful creator will know, there are certain guidelines you need to follow, or your budding career will never get off the ground. The TubeBuddy blog, plus ourYouTubeand social channels are chockful of tips and advice on how to kickstart a killer content strategy and avoid the pitfalls that catch out more unsuspecting creators. Our latest live stream takes a deep dive into the mistakes you can easily avoid on your journey. Click below for the full experience, or read the transcript below.
We’ve pulled out some of the key fails new or smaller, creators often make, which stop them from reaching their full potential. If this might be you then now is a great time to correct them.
#1 Stop Failing to Take Your Content Seriously
Many content creators wait for some kind of validation or success before they take content strategy seriously. Unfortunately, a lot of those content creators will end up giving up. Because they’re not taking it as seriously as they should, they don’t get that response that they’re after. We encourage you to shift that mindset if you want serious results. If I take things seriously now, then that’s actually how you end up getting the real results. That’s how you end up building a brand on YouTube. That’s how you end up getting more views on your content. That’s how you end up getting subscribers on your channel. Because you’re being intentional about everything.
#2 Don’t Leave Titles and Thumbnails to the Last Minute
If you want to grow Your YouTube Channel, you should understand thatcustom thumbnails and your titlesneed to work together to complement each other. One grabs a viewer’s attention, the other one encourages them to click play. So make sure that you’re always thinking about that before you make your video content so that you can match the expectations that people have. Team thumbnails and titles together to win the click and grow your YouTube channel.
#3 Not Connecting with YOUR Audience at Every Opportunity
It’s very tempting to mimic another creator to replicate their success. However, all that ends up happening is you become a poor copy of that person instead of being the best version of yourself. At the end of the day, what you want to make sure that you’re doing is that you’re making yourself connectable to the people thatyouare interacting with your content. Constantly imitating another creator is just going to lead to a dull channel and possible creator burnout.
#4 Failing To Do Any Research on Content Your Viewers Want
One of the hardest things for a creator who wants to grow on YouTube is to separate themselves from other people who are doing the same type of content. Only by understanding what you can uniquely bring to the space that nobody else is can help you stand out.
When it comes to the research side of things, you have to make sure that you are looking into topics that your audience is interested in. If you are not doing that research, then you are just making videos that you just want to make. That’s a great way to keep your view, and subscriber counts low. Take full advantage of TubeBuddy, Google Trends, YouTube Analytics, and other data sources to identify which interests and topics viewers are searching for and engaging with.
#5 Neglecting to Keep Your Skills Up to Date
The next big mistake creators make is not being in a constant state of skilled development. If you really want to thrive on YouTube, it’s essential to make sure that you are up to date with a range of skills or developing new ones.
Get good at copywriting because this will help with scriptwriting, as well as titles and descriptions. Learn how to design so you can make better thumbnails and better video graphics. Learn the art of videography and editing for obvious reasons. Develop your skills and experience in public speaking, charisma, psychology, marketing, and other fields to give you a heads-up on other creators.
#6 Not Playing the YouTube Game
Yes, when it comes to your content, you can have fun and take chances but if you don’t play by the phenomenally strict YouTube rules and guidelines you are risking too much. If you need a reminder onYouTube’s Community GuidelinesandTerms of Service, click on the links provided. Please don’t be that one creator that effs around and finds out.

STOP Making These Mistakes If You Want To Grow Your YouTube Channel: Transcript
If your YouTube content creator and you are having trouble getting the ball rolling, if you’re new to YouTube, if you have a small YouTube channel, no matter what it is that you seem to do, you just can’t break through today, we’re going to be talking about the main mistakes that content creators make that happen.
So if you are trying to overcome the lack of views that you’re currently getting on your YouTube channel and just the lack of activity, lack of comments, the lack of engagement, and all of that, then you’re definitely going to want to make sure that you tune into this. It’s usually because of a handful of core things that we are going to be talking about here during the stream today. There’s a nice list that I have here in front of me, but I’m going to focus on 10 to 12 different things that are the biggest mistakes that people make when it comes to YouTube.
Creator Mindset
So we’re going to go ahead and get started right now with the very first thing, which is themindset of a content creator.So, as content creators, we often have this thought in our mind when we’re first getting started to where we’ll think to ourselves, hey, I’m just going to kind of do what I need to do; maybe I’m going to, you know, put in, you know, some good effort with this and If things start going well on my YouTube channel, that is when I’m going to double down, that’s when I’m going to start really taking this seriously. That’s when I’m going to start really working on my skill sets and doing all the things that I need to do. Once a video starts getting traction, I start getting some attention to my YouTube channel. This particular thing, even though It seems trivial, but it can be a huge roadblock for a lot of content creators. And the reason for that is that if you are publishing content with the hopes of something doing well, then you start to take it seriously. So the fix for this is you want to switch things around and switch your perspective. So if you are somebody that wants to take this seriously and you want to turn this into something that you can do full time or maybe a side hustle, or you want to use it to get your message out, or just to bring, you know, some attention to yourself in that particular case, you have to change how you’re thinking about the approach.
What usually happens is when content creators come in, and they’re not focused on taking it seriously 1st, and they’re waiting for things to happen before they take it seriously. Then a lot of those content creators will end up stopping, or they’ll end up not getting traction and putting in all of this effort and all of this work and making videos. But because they’re not taking it as seriously as they should, they don’t get that response that they’re after. So because of that, I encourage you to fix this first one. I encourage you to shift that mindset if I want serious results. If I take things seriously now, then that’s actually how you end up getting the serious results. That’s how you end up building a brand on YouTube. That’s how you end up getting more views on your content. That’s how you end up getting subscribers on your channel. Because you’re being intentional about everything, it is what you’re doing because you are taking it seriously. You are looking at it for the opportunity that it is on YouTube.
Grow Your YouTube Channel:Titles and Thumbnails
Next up is not considering your titles and thumbnails before you make your videos. How many people here will make your video, and then once your video is done, you’re like, OK, how am I going to do the title and thumbnail?
If you’re one of those people, you’re actually working against yourself in that in that sense. But if you really want to thrive here on YouTube, the best thing you can do when it comes to your workflow is to think about the title and the thumbnail for your video before you ever make the content. Before you even consider actually hitting the record button. And the reason for that is that you might have an amazing idea for a piece of video content, but if you can’t package it correctly through the thumbnail in the title, then people aren’t going to see it. Really think about your idea; think about how I am going to illustrate this idea from the outside when somebody hasn’t had the chance to or the opportunity to watch my video yet when it’s just being presented to them on a home page. Or, you know, recommended next to another video or under another video. What am I going to do in my thumbnail title to one, help the viewer recognize that this content is something that they might care about, and two, by leveraging the title, compel them to click on this and the reason it’s so important to do this first and I know.
Not every content type you know can leverage this, but if your content type does support this, definitely do it. And here’s why: because a lot of people can get high click-through rates on their videos or on their thumbnails. But then, as soon as somebody hits the content, people end up bailing on the content. Or they just can’t get people to click on the videos, even though the content itself is good. So the problem is if you don’t think of your thumbnail and title first before you make your videos, what’s going to happen is you’re going to have to shoehorn your thumbnail and title around the video that you’ve already created, which means maybe your intro isn’t going to be a perfect match for your thumbnail and title. Maybe the way that you’re setting up the rest of the video isn’t going to be a great match for what the viewers are expecting when they come into the content. So because of that, you want to start thinking about when you come up with the video idea, OK, before I make this. How am I going to present this to people? I want you to think about is if I’m going to be presenting this to people from the outside. What type of expectation is this going to create for the viewer?
OK. So this puts this big question right there in your face. You know the content creator. And then from there, once you have that and you sketch out some ideas, you don’t have to build the thumbnail. But if you sketch out ideas like, OK, well, I’m going to have, you know, a 2-panel thumbnail. And on this side, I’m going to have this. And then, on this side, I’m going to show this. That’s going to ensure that you get the right footage and everything you need, the right shots that you need for it. But more importantly, it’s also going to ensure that when somebody sees that thumbnail and title, and they’re like, Oh yeah, this is definitely something that, you know, that I might be interested in, that they’re going to click into it. And then, when they come into the video content itself, they’re going to end up watching for a longer period of time.
And we all knowhow important watch timeis, so they’re going to end up watching for a longer period of time because you are going to be able to meet their expectations as they come into the video because you’re going to already know through your pre-planning of the thumbnail and the title, what that viewer is going to expect, or your intention for what it is that they’re going to expect when they come into the content, because of that. You want to make sure you’re always thinking about your thumbnail title before you actually make the content itself. And again, you don’t have to build it like you have to open up Photoshop or whatever it is you make your own. Thumbnails in and actually put everything together, but. If you have, if you have a tablet, sketch it out. If you have a, you know, notepad, you know, just grab a pencil and just sketch out some general ideas of what you think it’s going to be.
And as a part of that, also think about how your thumbnail and your titles work together to complement each other. One of the things that YouTube says is that your thumbnails and titles work together as a team to win the click. Because one grabs their attention, the other one pulls them through. So make sure that you’re always thinking about that before you make your video content so that you can match the expectations that people have.
Connect with Your Audienceto Grow Your YouTube Channel
One of the things with YouTube is that it’s about you, the content creator, right? So of course, you know, viewers are coming on, they want to watch content, they want to learn stuff, they want to be entertained, they want to be motivated, they want to, you know, be challenged with the way that they think or they want to jump into their echo chambers or whatever it is. But at the end of the day, what you want to make sure that you’re doing is that you’re making yourself connectable to the people that you are interacting with your content.
So here’s how you do that. So a lot of people will act like other content creators because, you know before they start their YouTube channels, a lot of new creators before they start their channels, they’ll see other content creators acting a certain way or doing certain things. No. Like, hey, I like this content creator, so therefore, I’m just going to mimic that content creator instead of just being myself. I’m going to try to be that person, right? And what ends up happening is you end up being a bad copy of that person instead of being the best version of yourself that is on camera. So instead of people connecting with you, they’re connecting with this, this persona of you that is based on someone else. And here’s a really bad thing about that, even if it starts working, and I’ve. I’ve actually known and worked with creators who have run into this situation. Even when it starts working, you are, in terms of your channel, doing better. If you take that path, you’re going to hit a point to where you’re going to be like, man, people aren’t even like coming here for me, right? They’re not even coming here like, you know, the person they’re interacting with, it’s not even me.
Right. And that can cause a lot of weird things to go on in your head. And then, eventually, you’ll burn out on trying to be that person. And then you’re going to deliver yourself to that audience, and they’ll be like, oh, they completely change. They’re doing something different now. They’re acting like a different person now. Like, what’s going on, and you’re going to give them a different experience.
So if you can start and be as much of yourself as you possibly can and leverage that uniqueness that we all have in that particular case, you’re going to be something that people can connect to at a deeper level; you’ll be able to sustain that over a long period of time, which is important if you’re somebody wants to do this for a long period of time.
Another thing as well is, you know, when you do start letting people know the nuances of your personality, the things that you like, the things that you don’t like, you know type of, you know, the person that you are the type of people that you like, you know. Are you a positive person? It’s usually from my other shot, but like, you know, personality items like, I’ve got some Star Wars stuff laying around, I’ve got VR headsets lying around, you know things. Like that, and some of those things are like just because it’s a good place to put it. But it’s also because I’m like, OK, well, somebody watches my videos, and they’re into Star Wars as an example. And I have my Stormtrooper helmet over here, my Stormtrooper Lego set thing over here. Then in that particular case, when people see that that are in the Star Wars right there, there’s that connection, right? Like, there’s something that we agree on, even if you don’t agree with everything that I’m saying and all that, and there’s something else. That we agree on that you know that we’re alike and. In some way same exact thing with the VR headsets or anything that you’re into. Also, that’s why you see a lot of content creators where they have like bookshelves, and you know all of these things in the background of all these different personality items or just shelves in general with all these personality items because one, it’s a display and it is a set in some cases. But also it gives people things to connect with things to relate to.
So because of that, make sure that you are always just giving yourself and that you are sharing those things that you are interested in; a great medium for this is. Live streaming and the reason that live streaming is great is because while you’re live streaming, you can kind of sidebar things and talk about, you know, little aspects. Just briefly talk about other things that you care about, about ways that you think about things, and all that that you may or may not insert into your video content. Currently, because live streams are just a little bit more, you know, relaxed and you know, and all of that stuff, and they’re not perfectly polished and all of that, which helps your personality come through, which is fantastic.
Do the Research!
Another huge problem that causes that is a lack of research. A lot of content creators will only study other content creators and their niche. I mean, it’s good to pay attention, and it’s good to pay attention to what videos they’re putting out, what’s working and not working on their channels, and things like that because you’re trying to tap into the same people. But if you’re only researching the people that are in your space and you’re digging into how they are operating, then it kind of keeps you in this little box in this little bubble to where it doesn’t leave a lot of room for growth. And a lot of room for ideas.
Even if you love something and then you start doing it, then somebody else in your space is doing it, then it’s like, Oh well, you know, I was doing that first, and then they kind of took this idea. And then they started doing it. But if you see another creator in a completely different type of content, you know, doing something like, wow, I love how they did that particular thing with their graphics, or I love how they, you know. Started their video with that, or I love these little pattern interrupts that they do and how they, you know, do these little things like that. I love their use of music from transitioning from, you know, scene to scene or topic to topic and things like that. When you start noticing those types of things on other types of content, it can create a lot of inspiration for you.
And it can break you out of the box of your niche because one of the hardest things on YouTube is separating yourself from the other people that are doing the same type of content you are. You know, like if you’re a gamer, for example, there’s a billion gamers on YouTube. What are you doing to separate yourself from everybody else? Right, of course. Hopefully, you’re being the, you know, best version of yourself as you can possibly be. But you should also be trying to think of what is something new that I could introduce into this based on some of this research that I’m doing of some of these other, you know, amazing content creators on the platform.
Like, what are some, you know, things that I can bring into our space that nobody else is currently bringing into our space? And by doing that, that’s going to help you stand out. Because as creatives right this is what we do. We’re like, hey, I want to make this, and then we get to work making it. But if you want to get the ball rolling faster, if you’re stuck in that period of, like, man, I just can’t get things moving, then in that particular case, you.
When it comes to the research side of things, you have to make sure that you know you are looking into topics that your audience is interested in. If you are, you know, not doing that research, then you can be making the videos that you just want to make, which is. Hey, but if you’re stuck in that box, and you’re trying to break out of that box because you keep hitting these ceilings with your view counts, the big problem and the big mistake that you could be making is not doing that research. And because of that, you create this ceiling to where there’s not a huge market for exactly what it is that you’re making topically. So because of that, when you start doing research, and you can use TubeBuddy for this, you can use their keyword explorer. You can use Google Trends for this, but the idea is just to start looking around and trying to get a pulse.
If I make this video based on this topic, what is the potential reach that I might be able to have? Because if you just make something, then in that particular case, if it’s something really unique and crazy, then in that particular case, yeah, I mean it, it might take off, but if you know going into it and you’re intentional, and you know, Hey, I’ve done the research on this, I know. That X amount of people are looking for this information based on other channels that are making similar content. Then, you know, when they publish videos that are similar to this, they end up, you know, doing good views and things like that. It just proves the potential for the video so that when you are publishing the content, you’re not thinking to yourself, this video isn’t doing well because it’s not because people aren’t interested in it. Maybe it’s because of how people are responding to the video maybe. I’m not able to get people to click because I’ve proven already before I even made the content.
So you just want to make sure that you are doing that leg work, so to speak, and making sure that you’re giving yourself that opportunity to. One trick that a lot of content creators use, or one you know, a tip that you’ll hear a lot, is to, you know, pick a very, you know, knit specific subject that’s great and that’s good advice.
But if you only make content that is just super isolated and super niche, then you’re just limiting your potential. But if you’re like, hey, as part of my content strategy. And for those of you who are not familiar with content strategy, it’s basically planning out your content over a short or long period of time and giving purpose to each individual piece of content in order to fulfill goals that you have for your channel or your business, or you know whatever it is that you’re making content for. So when you’re putting your content strategy together, you can say, hey, I’m going to cover these niche topics because. Not a lot of people are covering them, and that’s going to give me a bunch of leaves on the branches, too. But then I’m also going to try to go after the trunk, right? I’m going to try to actually go after the main core part of the tree here, where most of the viewership is on YouTube, and I’m going to try to tap into that as well. So, just kind of mixing in some broader topics within your niche so that you can give yourself that potential to kind of breakthrough that ceiling that you’re currently hitting.
Another part when it comes to, you know, research is you also want to make sure that you are a student of the platform. I kind of touched on this briefly a second ago, but you want to make sure that you are looking at your content type and other creators in your niche, and you also want to make sure that you are just hopping into YouTube search and seeing what pops up in YouTube search and just watching some cooking videos and seeing what they’re doing for the high performing cooking videos like how are they keep people engaged. How are they starting their videos? What kind of structure are they doing with what it is that they’re doing? Go look at, you know, if you’re not a gamer, go watch some gaming videos that might, you know, inspire you because they do some really cool stuff in the gaming space. If you are making videos about fashion, then in that particular case, watching videos on tech. You know, even though it’s not related to fashion, watching videos on tech, you could see something that the tech folks are doing that could inspire you with your content and vice versa as well.
So, becoming a student of YouTube, watching content that’s outside of your space, not as a viewer. But as somebody that’s studying that content can also be a way to give you new ideas and kind of freshen up your perspective and also be able to pull some of that, you know, type of stuff into your content. But most importantly though, you know outside of that part is just making sure that you are looking into the potential reach that you have with every video that you publish. If you’re trying to break out of that. You know, the box that you’re currently locked into next problem, and this is this is huge on YouTube. I’m guilty of this. Every content creator is guilty of this until they hit a threshold, and then they’re like, ah, you know what, it’s actually not as good as I thought it was. And that is thinking your videos are amazing.
So don’t be offended by this, but here’s here’s how this works. So when we are coming up with ideas for our videos, we’re thinking to ourselves, like, yeah, this is a good idea. People are going to like this, then we go, and we start making the content itself, and we put everything together, and we edit it, and we share the information that we think is good, and we share, you know, the experiences. I should say that we. That’s good. And then we edit those videos in the way that we like, and we use the music that we like, and we use the graphics that we like, and we use the pacing that we like, and we do everything based on our tastes. Well, in some cases, that’s a perfect match for how other people are interacting or how other people appreciate content. And in some cases, it’s the opposite of how other people respond to content.
I hang out in YouTuber communities on Facebook and Discord and on Reddit as well, and one of the things I constantly see is new content creators saying things like my videos are great. I don’t understand why people are not interacting with my content, but they’re interacting with this. This other channel doesn’t seem to put a lot of effort into what it is. That they’re doing. Right. The problem there is not that the content is great, and it’s not getting a response. The problem there is the creator is biased toward their own content, and it’s clouding their vision of why people are not responding to what it is that they’re doing compared to what it is that other people are doing. Right.
So if you’re trying to grow at scale and you’re trying to break out of that box, you have to make sure that you’re open to the idea. that your content is just like mine, just like everybody else that’s hanging out here, just like everybody else on YouTube. Our content might need some improvement, right? And you have to embrace that idea because if you right now, you know, especially you’re getting started, if you right now you’re like, hey, this stuff is amazing and it might, it might be, but if people aren’t responding to it like it’s amazing, then that means other people don’t find it as amazing as you do. Therefore, you have to use the analytics that YouTube gives us to better understand how people at scale are responding to what it is that you’re doing and then make adjustments as necessary.
Some of the things that you want to look for are your audience retention report and a second-by-second graph of how people are responding to our content. On average, over time. So what you can look forward, you looking for places in your videos where you get spikes where people are rewinding or rewatching parts of your videos or people are sharing it out. And that’s an entry point. You can also see places in your video where people dip out. And those are problem areas because you’re causing people to leave. Another thing is that inside of your audience retention report, you also have from the drop-down if you’re on a computer, you have relative audience retention. So relative audience retention, which has been renamed to how your videos compared to other videos on YouTube or compared to other videos, is the language they use. But when you use that drop-down, that gives you real insights to how you’re comparing against other videos of similar length on the platform. So it just gives you insights. So it gives you stuff, it gives you information so you can know what it is that you need to work on. And then from there, you’re like, hey, you know what? My videos are actually compared to other videos. They’re not that bad. I’m pretty good at keeping people consistent.
Part of that is you have to look at your ability to get people to click, and then you have to look at your ability to get people to continue watching other videos on YouTube. So when it comes to getting people to click, YouTube shows us what’s called our click-through rate and what your click-through rate is on YouTube. It shows your video to people on the platform. That’s called an impression. That’s what. That’s what it’s called in your YouTube analytics. So your click-through rate is for every impression that YouTube shows, you know, every time YouTube shows your videos to people on the platform, how many of those people convert into an actual viewer, somebody that clicked on.
So the average is on YouTube, just so you know between 2 and 10%. YouTube does not give us impression data for that. They just tell us that the average. On YouTube is between 2 and 10%. So what you need to do overtime is you need to figure out what the averages are in your channel and then start mapping your click-through rate against that. So if you notice, hey, I’m coming in pretty low here, then you know to make a change. Of some kind.
You want to make sure that you are looking at your audience retention reports and that you’re seeing what is happening at the end of your videos. This is really important because a huge mistake that a lot of new content creators make, and it’s just because they see other people going on YouTube.
Go into the top right-hand corner of your analytics for an individual video or at the channel level, There’s an advanced mode so you can click on that and it takes you into like a whole other area of advanced analytics and you can get all kinds of amazing information in there. But one of the things that you can do is once you’re on that page, you’re going to see a navigation tab for traffic sources. When you click on that. On an individual video level, you’re going to see what your click-through rate and average view duration look like coming from home page viewers. What does it look like coming from suggested video viewers? What does it look like coming from search viewers? And based on what you’re trying to accomplish with your channel and the goals that you’re trying to, you know, achieve in viewership or whatever it is that you’re doing channel for, then you know that information can ensure that you’re taking the right approach there.
In fact, if you’re using TubeBuddy’s AB testing tool, it gives you some of that information to make it easier to understand where you can upload two different thumbnails, and it’ll compare them back and forth against each other. And it’ll tell you, like, hey, on home pages, this one does the better search. This one does better-suggested videos. This one does better, and then that way, based on what it is that you or where it is that you’re trying to get traffic from it, it tells you how competitive you are there.
Keeping Your Skills Up to Date
The next big mistake is not being in a constant state of skilled development as a content creator. So look, I know that a lot of people have jobs and schools and families. I mean, I would say everyone has other things that they do outside of YouTube. Most people, not everybody. But you know, people have, you know, things that they do outside of YouTube. So because of that, you know, life is just busy. However, if you really want to thrive on YouTube, it’s really important to make sure that you are in a constant state of skill development, and the reason for that is that this stuff is hard. You’re competing against some very talented people, and it doesn’t matter what niche you’re in; there are people in the niche who are talented. You might be one of those. Some of it is learned talent, where people have over a period of time they’ve learned how to do things better than most people, which is why they get the the results that they do. So because of that, you want to be in a constant state of skill development.
Make sure that you’re, you’re studying content around writing titles copywriting because that’s, you know, also title-related, design so you can make better thumbnails and make better video graphics. You can take your videos from looking janky to looking nice and polished because you know you learned how to do it. Videography, because you know, there’s there’s rules and concepts to all these things, like framing. And, you know, all of that. You also need to make sure that you are, you know, consuming content and practicing around public speaking, charisma, psychology, marketing, editing, using all the different you know tools that you have available.
You have to learn how to communicate effectively, you have to learn how to grab people’s attention through imagery and through text. You have to learn how you know concepts of editing so that you can, you know, make sure that you keep people engaged and watching the content. When you’re editing, that’s more of a verb, right? Like you’re actively intentionally trying to bring people through the content based on what it is that you are sharing with them. And based on how it is that you’re that you’re structuring everything through the content. And based on the different choices that you’re making. And as you go through the content, there’s a YouTube channel that everybody here should watch, Hayden Hellier Smith. He edits for, like, Logan Paul and some other big creators. If you watch one of his videos, it’s going to blow your mind. going to like, oh, wow. Never even thought about that stuff. And it’s because he’s a professional editor. Like, that’s what he does. And he does it, you know, at a very high level. So that’s what he studies.
When it comes to skill development, if you want to do better, you know at the thing of YouTube, then you have to be better at the thing of YouTube. And the only way to fulfill that is by working on yourself and developing the skill sets needed. His name is Hayden Hellier. Smith, if you just type in, start typing in like Hayden Hellier Smith or even if Hayden Smith maybe that it that might get him to come up in YouTube search. But yeah, just incredible in terms of just you know concepts that he shares, and if you just pay attention to the nuance of how he explains things that can really give you a lot of insights into what goes into editing.
Keep Experimenting
It’s easy for us to get kind of stuck in our ways. And as you start getting more and more successful on the platform. Because you’ll be like, hey, this is working. I’m going to do it forever. Right. But people change the platform changes. You know, competition comes into the space like all kinds of different things happen that can impact you as an individual channel and an individual creator. So because of that, you should always, even if, even if you’re like, hey. I’m going to do just let’s play this on my channel, and that’s all I’m going to do. If you’re not getting the results, doing that experiment with something else, keep doing that. But experiment with doing something else. Because maybe you are good. Maybe you’re good, you know, at playing the game.
Maybe you’re entertaining to watch, but maybe you’re an amazing teacher. And when it comes to showing people how to, you know, navigate in certain parts of the game and put content together in a way that teaches people how to do something, maybe you’re maybe you’re, like, the best. In the gaming niche at that. But you haven’t given it a chance yet because you’re stuck over here doing, doing let’s play is because that’s what you think you should be doing, right? So because of that, just make sure that you’re open to experimenting. Like, you know, right now on my on my YouTube channel. So I have always run an experiment, so I just came off of a year of doing weekly news on my YouTube channel.. When I was first doing it, a lot of people were coming back. I was getting a lot of return viewers, but because the news wasn’t really that big, even though it added a decent amount of subscribers to my channel, it added about $10,000 a year. You know, to the to the ad revenue.
The channel, even though those things happened after a while, it’s like, well, the news isn’t that impactful. It’s just kind of like little nuanced updates here and there, maybe some industry news things like that. And at scale, people who are watching my videos just don’t care as much about that. So because of that, once the novelty wore off, the things that I was talking about weren’t as big of a deal. Then you know the news started becoming less and less important. So now. That experiment is over. It was working for a while, so now what I’m doing is I’m not doing the weekly news anymore, and instead, I’m waiting for news that is impactful.
So it’s like, you know, hey is what, what’s you know, is there something major that’s happening right now? And then I’ll talk about, you know, I’ll talk about that, you know, for example, like, you know, the shorts adding the, you know, links right there. On the page where we can direct people to any video that’s gigantic, right? Same thing with them taking the links out of YouTube shorts. Gigantic, you know, news. So because of that, you know, I made sure to make a video about it. But on the experimental side, now I’m like, hey, AI’s coming around. So let’s go ahead and mix trends with, you know, something that’s trending with, you know, with an experimental bucket. And then, with that, what a bucket is. It’s basically like a set of videos, right? It’s like a series or a type of content that you make compared to the other. Videos that you may. Right, so now I’m experimenting with, you know, AI content. So, I’ve got a couple of AI shorts. I’ve got an AI video, and then I’m getting ready to publish another one tomorrow on my channel. That’s an AI video. And out of those, you know, I’ll, I’ll do them until people, you know, start falling off of those as well. But the whole idea is. If what you’re doing isn’t working, experiment because you know, again, you could be amazing. You know, creator at this thing right here, but you could be OK at this thing over here, right?
So just always experimenting to give yourself that, you know, stimulus, so to speak. And just to see if you, you know, if you’re better suited for another aspect of what it is that you’re. The next one, and I get some blowback when I talk about this one, so I’m ready for it. If you want to, you know, kind of roast me up here in the comments. It’s perfectly OK. So what I’m talking about is basically breaking out-of-the-box if somebody’s having trouble, you know, getting more views on your content, and you’re somebody that is, you know, trying to figure out how to navigate all this stuff and talk about the mistakes that content creators typically make that.
That keeps them from growing, but the next one is monetization. So part of growing as a content creator is having money to be able to do all of the things you know as a content creator to get equipment to pay for services like, you know, TubeBuddy to go to conferences like VidSummit to, you know, get the right camera gear to be able to fly places if you want to, to do collaborations, if that’s something that you’re interested in. All of those things, you know, they make money. So because of that, the general rule of thumb people are like, oh, yeah, don’t monetize until you get at least 10,000 subscribers on your YouTube channel and things like that, I totally agree. we’ve got Jill’s comfort zone in the house. And we have Gusman in the house right now. And out of those people that I just mentioned and everybody else here, your next video could be the video that puts you on the map. And if you have a video that you publish and that video starts going nuts in terms of, like, you’re getting a really high response on it. So YouTube showing it to everybody.
Get Real About MonetizationWhen You Aim Grow Your YouTube Channel:
Start thinking about monetization as fast as you possibly can because of how YouTube works If you have a video pop off and you have a video that just starts thriving, then what’s going to happen is the people that are interacting with that video, YouTube is going to detect that they’re enjoying that content. So YouTube is going to say, hey, people are liking this content. So what else on this channel is a good fit for this person? And then YouTube’s going to start recommending some of your old content to them. And if you don’t have some of these monetization things in place, then what’s going to happen is that originating video that, you know, kind of blew your channel up, you’re going to miss the opportunity there and you’re going to miss it on all of the videos down the line where you can just simply have descriptions in your links. You don’t even have to be on reviews or anything. You can just have links in your description. That leads people into, you know, additional things, and in your videos you just simply mentioned, hey, got links in the description or, you know whatever.
So you know, missing out on those opportunities is definitely something that you do not want to do. And Monique says I got two more affiliates. So I need to update my description templates. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Get them in.
Stick to the YouTube Rules
So next up on the list. Is not knowing the game that you’re playing. So like I mentioned before, I’m in all the YouTube community, so I’m in the communities, on Reddit and on Facebook and Discord like this is how I like. Stay sharp, you know, in terms of like knowing. What it is? That you guys want. OK, so because of that, one of the things that I see a lot is people going into Reddit or Facebook. Group and like, oh man, YouTube. Deleted my channel for no. Man, I got a copyright strike. I don’t know what’s going on. I just use 5 seconds of that song and people are making all these complaints. But the reason that you know, channels get taken down is because people violate their rules. It’s not that YouTube is like, oh, hey, this channel right here, let’s just take them down. Like it doesn’t work that way.
The reason channels get taken down is because the creators are violating the rules. So if you want to do this as a content creator for an extended period of time and you don’t want to run the risk of, you know, losing everything once you do get out of that you know box and you can get more views in your content then make sure that you are keeping up the rules. So YouTube has terms of service. Take an afternoon to read through it. You don’t have to memorize it. Just read through it and consider the type of content that you’re publishing and consider you know the things that you’re going on. Platform. They have community guidelines, the same exact thing. Make sure you take an afternoon, and you read through them. And again, you don’t have to remember everything.
You just have to think, OK, with the content that I’m putting out, how does this apply to me and are there any lines that I’m, you know, kind of any roles that I’m in the Gray area of or is there anything that I’m doing that could come back to bite me? In the future, I had a situation. So one of the first videos I put out on my channel was a video about how to download a thumbnail from YouTube. So I put out this video before we had the option to just download from inside of the Creator studio and one of the things for that video, I mean, this is my fault because I didn’t know the rules, but one of the things in that video. Is as I start the video right I pop up like this. I’m like and I’m wearing a ski mask and I have the, you know, scene and everything where it looks like it’s dark. So I have like cricket sound effects going on in the background. Like I’m going to show you how to steal any thumbnail off of YouTube, but then once we get into the video itself cuz that was just part of the hook. But once we got into the video itself, I’m like, hey, you know, images are copyright protected, blah blah. So you don’t want to take other people. ‘S thumbnails but. If you need to use your thumbnail for some reason, this is how you get it, and I showed people how to go into the code on a web page. And find the thumbnail and then copy it out and then save it to their computer in case they want to use it in a video or something. Well, because I didn’t know the rules years later, like two years later, YouTube gave me a copyright or a community guideline strike because I was showing people, even though at that time they had the option where you could download thumbnails directly. I was showing people how to circumvent YouTube, you know systems in order to get that thumbnail. So fortunately I was able to get everything you know, you know, fixed up with that to where it wasn’t a big deal video got reinstated. I still deleted it because I was like. Yeah, I don’t. I’m not. You know, I don’t want to have that.
But the thing I’m trying to express though is like you got to know, you got to know the rules of the game that you’re playing, because if not, you can create something amazing and you can start to get the results that you want. And then one either some, you know, hate or some jerk is going to use it against you and report you or something like that, or you’re just going to end up getting caught up in the system where, you know, everything is automated and all that, and you’re going to go through some long process of trying to dispute it. Or like some of the people I see on Reddit and Facebook, you might end up in one of those situations where you lose it all just because you didn’t know the rules of the game, right? So make sure that you make sure you figure that out. Or make sure you pay attention to that. And another thing that’s really important and this one isn’t necessarily going to break you out-of-the-box, but this one is something that you need to make sure that you’re thinking about. For those of you that are wanted to do this for a long period of time, make sure that when it comes to uploading your content, you’re thinking of consistency not from the aspect of I need to. Make sure I’m publishing videos every. So often to YouTube, but I need to work on the process of ideation and creation and publishing of my content into my lifestyle.
File so that every week I’m taking very specific actions to ensure that I get content up so that I can continue publishing videos in my live stream just last week. So I do a live stream on my main channel where I answer questions for 3 hours straight, and I have a form. You know the people fill in the information there, and somebody you know left the question like hey, I don’t know what’s going on. I’m publishing videos to my channel, but my channel is not growing. I’m going to look at the channel, and the person will publish for like one week, and then they won’t publish again for two months, and then they’ll go, and they’ll publish for, you know, maybe one or two other videos and they won’t publish it. For a few months, they’re just not giving themselves a chance on YouTube because they’re not staying recent in viewer histories, which is something that’s important. But they’re also just not working.
The process of creating content in their lifestyle and it’s causing them to be inconsistent on the platform and inconsistent with the process and their lifestyle, which makes the whole thing unsustainable. So if you are somebody that that is like, hey, I want to turn this into something I want to, you know, take it seriously. Then in that particular case, make sure you work on that side of consistency, right? And it’s going to result in you publishing content on a regular basis at a consistent pace, but you just want to make sure that you’re working that process. Of ideation, creating, and publishing the content into your regular life cycle and your regular lifestyle. And of course, be patient because you know expectations. A lot of people will come in, they’ll see these videos on TikTok and on YouTube, where they’re like. I started a YouTube channel, and within the last 10 days, I got 10,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel. Yeah, that’s great. But if you watch those videos, you can tell if you know, if you’re experienced, you can tell when you’re watching those videos.

14 Tips on How to Grow Fast on YouTube in 2023
If you are an aspiring content creator looking for how to grow fast on YouTube, you’ve probably heard the timeless advice: “just be consistent!”
So, you take that to heart and upload video after video. You’re committed to being consistent for weeks and months. But despite your efforts, you don’t see the growth you’d hoped for.
Why is that? Well, consistency is key but YouTube success is about more than just consistency. Plus, navigating the YouTube landscape can be challenging, especially when it comes to knowing which tools to add to your arsenal.
Enter TubeBuddy — a browser extension and YouTube SEO solution that helps optimize YouTube videos and channels for better search visibility and audience engagement.
But that’s just the beginning.
Read on for 14 tips to help you grow fast on YouTube, showing how TubeBuddy can help. Follow these tips to get more subscribers, increased watch time, and higher rankings in YouTube search results over time.
How to Grow Fast on YouTube
#1 Come Up with Strong Content Ideas
Every fantastic video starts with a powerful idea. No matter how fancy your production is or how often you upload, if your ideas aren’t hitting the mark, your video won’t either.
YouTube superstarMrBeasthas this to say about content ideas:
“The idea is so freaking important. Most YouTubers could pull triple the views with half the work if they have better ideas. Once you realize how important the idea is, you just obsess about how to get more ideas.”
The key takeaway here is that it’s not just about how often you upload content; it’s all about the brilliance of your ideas. One strong idea can take your channel to much greater heights than a dozen weaker ones. So, here are some creative idea-generation tips for your next video:
Brainstorming ideas may take time, but the payoff will be worth it.
#2 Conduct Keyword Research for SEO with Tubebuddy
When you upload a video on YouTube, you want it to be easily discoverable by people interested in your content. Let’s explore how TubeBuddy’sKeyword Explorerfeature can assist you in conducting keyword research for YouTube SEO.
Suppose you’re interested in creating YouTube content about smart security cameras. To begin your keyword research, you navigate to YouTube and access the TubeBuddy panel. From there, you click on the Keyword Explorer option. You should see the screen below.
Enter the term “smart security cameras” in the search panel to get started.
Once you do this, the tool will present you with some initial data that you can use to carry out research. This data includes information such as keyword competition, search volume, and optimization strength.
When you search for something using TubeBuddy, you’ll see two scores:WeightedandUnweighted.
TheUnweighted Scoreis a general score, it’s quite broad and doesn’t consider your own YouTube channel. So, relying solely on the Unweighted Score might not give you the most accurate picture as it doesn’t consider your channel’s past content, metadata, and engagements.
To get a score specifically calculated for your channel, clickWeighted.
Accessing the Weighted Score does require a paid TubeBuddy license,  but it offers valuable insights into what could work best for you as a creator on your channel. By using your Weighted Score, you can better understand whether you have a good chance of ranking well for a particular keyword.
The other important metrics you should pay attention to are competition and optimization strength.
Lastly, in the bottom right corner you’ll find a list of long-tail keywords related to your seed keyword. These terms are helpful when you want to improve both your videos and your chances of being found in search results.
By following these steps and using TubeBuddy’sKeyword Explorerfeature, you’ll gather all the data you need to create your next stand-out video and ensure it’s optimized for better visibility.
YouTube Keyword Research – You’re Doing it WRONG!
#3 Optimize Video Titles, Descriptions, and Tags
Optimizing video titles and descriptions is another helpful strategy to grow rapidly on YouTube and improve your video’s visibility to potential viewers. These elements serve as essential metadata that help YouTube’s algorithm understand and rank your content in search results and related content sections.
Here are some practical tips to consider when optimizing your video titles and tags:
Here’s an example of a clear and concise video title:

Remember, you must always be honest in your metadata. Misleading titles or tags may lead to viewer dissatisfaction and hurt your channel’s reputation. Try out TubeBuddy’sTitle Generatorto come up with a list of titles for your next video. Just type in your title, and the generator will make it YouTube-friendly.
Also, you may want to update your video metadata after several months to ensure it remains relevant to search queries. Continuing with the above example, as time goes on, the popularity of vegan restaurants in Athens may change, and new establishments may open. For example, you might update the title to: “2024’s Top 10 Vegan Restaurants in Athens”.
Or revise your description. If you’ve featured seasonal dishes or special events from the restaurants, mention them in the description  to ensure it reflects the current state of the vegan dining scene in Athens.
Regularly updating your video metadata is a valuable time investment because it keeps your content up-to-date with what people are currently searching for on YouTube.
When your video stays relevant to search queries, it becomes more discoverable and contributes to the growth of your YouTube channel.
#4 Create Amazing Thumbnails
When viewers browse YouTube, your thumbnail is often the first thing they see. So, having a custom thumbnail allows you to create a visually appealing image that grabs their attention.
One powerful approach, though dependent on the nature of your channel’s content, is using human faces in thumbnails.
Human faces naturally evoke emotions and feelings of connection. If your channel focuses on personal stories, vlogs, or anything related to human experiences, featuring a person’s face can make the video more relatable.
Below is a goodexampleof youTube thumbnails that feature the creator’s face.
If you find it challenging to create amazing thumbnails or are struggling to decide which one to use for your next video content,TubeBuddyoffers a helpful solution through itsThumbnail Analyzerfeature.
This feature uses AI to generate a heatmap replicating how the human eye interacts with thumbnails. Using the Thumbnail Analyzer, you can gain insights into your thumbnails’ performance, understanding which areas attract the most attention and which might be overlooked.
A/B Testing with TubeBuddy! More than Thumbnails!
#5 Stick to a Consistent Posting Schedule
By regularly uploading videos, you stay at the forefront of your audience’s minds and increase their chances of discovering your content. So, how do you do  this exactly?
Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Start with a schedule that you can realistically manage without sacrificing quality. Whether it’s twice a week or once every two weeks, make it achievable for yourself or your team.
Planning is key, so use a content calendar to organize your ideas and ensure a smooth flow of videos.
See the below example. “Moore’s Law is Dead” channel uploads a fresh video every 3 or 4 days. That’s some serious consistency, and consistency is the secret sauce for growing fast on YouTube.
#6 Collaborate with other Content Creators in Your Niche
When you collaborate with like-minded creators, you tap into their established fan base, exposing your content to a potentially new and engaged audience. Here are some best practices for successful collaborations:
Check out the below example. It’s a collaboration between Teddy Baldassarre, a watch enthusiast, and Kevin O’Leary, the Canadian businessman and TV personality who collects expensive watches.
The great thing about this collab is that both creators are passionate about watches, so their content is engaging and valuable. And when you watch thevideo, you’ll see they’re both having a blast doing what they love.

#7 Encourage Audience Interaction with a Pinned Comment
Pinning a comment at the top of your video’s comments is like waving a flag to attract everyone’s attention. You can use it to deliver a special message or get people to take action and join the discussion.
It works because a pinned comment sticks at the top, making it much more likely for viewers to notice it.
Let’s see a greatexampleof a pinned comment that received 1.1K likes and 330+ replies.
Lastly, if you really want to boost engagement, don’t just leave the pinned comment hanging there. Reply to the comments on that pinned message. Show your audience some love and let them know you care about what they have to say.
#8 Promote Your Videos on Other Social Platforms
Promoting your YouTube videos on other social platforms is an effective strategy because it allows you to tap into a broader audience base and maximize your reach. By leveraging the existing user base on platforms like Instagram, X (previously Twitter), Facebook, and TikTok, you can attract viewers who might not have seen your content.
Here’s a detailed guide onhow to promote YouTube videos on Instagram.
We often see creators get lost when it comes to social media promotion. So, here are some things you should avoid:
#9 Incorporate Storytelling to Captivate Your Audience
When you weave a compelling story, you connect with your audience beyond just providing information. Stories trigger emotional responses and leave a lasting impact on viewers.
A well-structured narrative typically includes a beginning that hooks the audience, a middle that builds tension or presents a problem, and an ending that delivers a satisfying resolution or valuable takeaway.
Keep your storytelling concise and well-paced to maintain your viewers’ interest throughout the video. Use visuals, effects, and appropriate background music to enhance the narrative’s impact during your edit.
Imagine you’re a YouTuber discussing money management and personal finance topics. One of the logical approaches to storytelling in this niche would be sharing a personal story of overcoming debt and achieving financial freedom while mentioning the steps you took along the way. Such a narrative could inspire and motivate viewers who might be struggling with their finances.
Small Channels… Do THIS to INSTANTLY Improve YouTube Videos!
#10 Run Contests or Giveaways to Increase Engagement
Running contests on YouTube is another effective yet overlooked way to grow fast because it encourages audience engagement and participation. When people see the chance to win something valuable, they are more likely to interact with your content, like, comment, and share it with others, boosting your video’s visibility and reach.
Here’s one example: the creator offers a $5,000 prize to the contest winner.
Best Cardboard Art Wins $5,000 Challenge!
Follow these steps to get the most out of your YouTube contests:
#11 Produce Mini-Trailers for Upcoming Content
When you post teasers, viewers get intrigued and become eager to watch the long-form version when it drops. It’s all about building excitement and keeping them hooked. Plus, teasers are short and snappy, perfect for catching attention.
Add some flair to your teasers. Use visuals, cool editing, and catchy background music to set the mood. Make it impossible for viewers to look away.
Here’s an example by ASUS, an electronics company, teasing some upcoming exciting news. It got over 365K views.
Timing is key. Drop your teasers strategically before the full content release. It builds anticipation and keeps the momentum going.
And don’t forget to mention the release date of your full content in the teaser. This way, people know exactly when they can see the whole video.
#12 Improve Video Production Quality
When people watch videos on YouTube, they want to enjoy a good experience. Better video production quality means that your videos will look and sound more appealing and professional. This makes viewers more likely to stick around, watch the video, and subscribe to your channel.
How To EASILY Get More Views on YouTube!
Think about it like this: Imagine watching a blurry, shaky video with bad audio. It’s not enjoyable, right? You would probably lose interest and click away.
But if you come across a video with clear visuals, smooth camera work, and crisp audio, you’re more likely to keep watching and come back for more.
Take the time to learn about lighting, camera techniques, editing, and sound recording. As you make these improvements you’ll attract more YouTube viewers and grow fast.
#13 Host Live Streams
Unlike pre-recorded videos, live streams allow you to connect with your audience immediately as they watch, just like chatting with friends in real life.
People care about live streams because it feels more personal and authentic. They can interact with you directly by leaving comments, asking questions, or even participating in polls and games you might run during the stream.
On the other hand, live streams offer a way to cover trending topics or breaking news, making your content timely and relevant. People tend to tune in for live events because they don’t want to miss out on anything exciting happening in real-time.
#14 Embrace the Journey of Constant Improvement
This is our last recommendation for your YouTube growth. No matter how many tips you’ve followed, there’s always room for improvement. That’s why regularly testing, experimenting, and analyzing data should be a cornerstone of your content strategy.
Use TubeBuddy’sSEO Studioto optimize your videos and channels for SEO and increase your visibility. The SEO Studio checks your YouTube videos and channel.

14 Tips on How to Grow Fast on YouTube in 2023
If you are an aspiring content creator looking for how to grow fast on YouTube, you’ve probably heard the timeless advice: “just be consistent!”
So, you take that to heart and upload video after video. You’re committed to being consistent for weeks and months. But despite your efforts, you don’t see the growth you’d hoped for.
Why is that? Well, consistency is key but YouTube success is about more than just consistency. Plus, navigating the YouTube landscape can be challenging, especially when it comes to knowing which tools to add to your arsenal.
Enter TubeBuddy — a browser extension and YouTube SEO solution that helps optimize YouTube videos and channels for better search visibility and audience engagement.
But that’s just the beginning.
Read on for 14 tips to help you grow fast on YouTube, showing how TubeBuddy can help. Follow these tips to get more subscribers, increased watch time, and higher rankings in YouTube search results over time.
How to Grow Fast on YouTube
#1 Come Up with Strong Content Ideas
Every fantastic video starts with a powerful idea. No matter how fancy your production is or how often you upload, if your ideas aren’t hitting the mark, your video won’t either.
YouTube superstarMrBeasthas this to say about content ideas:
“The idea is so freaking important. Most YouTubers could pull triple the views with half the work if they have better ideas. Once you realize how important the idea is, you just obsess about how to get more ideas.”
The key takeaway here is that it’s not just about how often you upload content; it’s all about the brilliance of your ideas. One strong idea can take your channel to much greater heights than a dozen weaker ones. So, here are some creative idea-generation tips for your next video:
Brainstorming ideas may take time, but the payoff will be worth it.
#2 Conduct Keyword Research for SEO with Tubebuddy
When you upload a video on YouTube, you want it to be easily discoverable by people interested in your content. Let’s explore how TubeBuddy’sKeyword Explorerfeature can assist you in conducting keyword research for YouTube SEO.
Suppose you’re interested in creating YouTube content about smart security cameras. To begin your keyword research, you navigate to YouTube and access the TubeBuddy panel. From there, you click on the Keyword Explorer option. You should see the screen below.
Enter the term “smart security cameras” in the search panel to get started.
Once you do this, the tool will present you with some initial data that you can use to carry out research. This data includes information such as keyword competition, search volume, and optimization strength.
When you search for something using TubeBuddy, you’ll see two scores:WeightedandUnweighted.
TheUnweighted Scoreis a general score, it’s quite broad and doesn’t consider your own YouTube channel. So, relying solely on the Unweighted Score might not give you the most accurate picture as it doesn’t consider your channel’s past content, metadata, and engagements.
To get a score specifically calculated for your channel, clickWeighted.
Accessing the Weighted Score does require a paid TubeBuddy license,  but it offers valuable insights into what could work best for you as a creator on your channel. By using your Weighted Score, you can better understand whether you have a good chance of ranking well for a particular keyword.
The other important metrics you should pay attention to are competition and optimization strength.
Lastly, in the bottom right corner you’ll find a list of long-tail keywords related to your seed keyword. These terms are helpful when you want to improve both your videos and your chances of being found in search results.
By following these steps and using TubeBuddy’sKeyword Explorerfeature, you’ll gather all the data you need to create your next stand-out video and ensure it’s optimized for better visibility.
YouTube Keyword Research – You’re Doing it WRONG!
#3 Optimize Video Titles, Descriptions, and Tags
Optimizing video titles and descriptions is another helpful strategy to grow rapidly on YouTube and improve your video’s visibility to potential viewers. These elements serve as essential metadata that help YouTube’s algorithm understand and rank your content in search results and related content sections.
Here are some practical tips to consider when optimizing your video titles and tags:
Here’s an example of a clear and concise video title:

Remember, you must always be honest in your metadata. Misleading titles or tags may lead to viewer dissatisfaction and hurt your channel’s reputation. Try out TubeBuddy’sTitle Generatorto come up with a list of titles for your next video. Just type in your title, and the generator will make it YouTube-friendly.
Also, you may want to update your video metadata after several months to ensure it remains relevant to search queries. Continuing with the above example, as time goes on, the popularity of vegan restaurants in Athens may change, and new establishments may open. For example, you might update the title to: “2024’s Top 10 Vegan Restaurants in Athens”.
Or revise your description. If you’ve featured seasonal dishes or special events from the restaurants, mention them in the description  to ensure it reflects the current state of the vegan dining scene in Athens.
Regularly updating your video metadata is a valuable time investment because it keeps your content up-to-date with what people are currently searching for on YouTube.
When your video stays relevant to search queries, it becomes more discoverable and contributes to the growth of your YouTube channel.
#4 Create Amazing Thumbnails
When viewers browse YouTube, your thumbnail is often the first thing they see. So, having a custom thumbnail allows you to create a visually appealing image that grabs their attention.
One powerful approach, though dependent on the nature of your channel’s content, is using human faces in thumbnails.
Human faces naturally evoke emotions and feelings of connection. If your channel focuses on personal stories, vlogs, or anything related to human experiences, featuring a person’s face can make the video more relatable.
Below is a goodexampleof youTube thumbnails that feature the creator’s face.
If you find it challenging to create amazing thumbnails or are struggling to decide which one to use for your next video content,TubeBuddyoffers a helpful solution through itsThumbnail Analyzerfeature.
This feature uses AI to generate a heatmap replicating how the human eye interacts with thumbnails. Using the Thumbnail Analyzer, you can gain insights into your thumbnails’ performance, understanding which areas attract the most attention and which might be overlooked.
A/B Testing with TubeBuddy! More than Thumbnails!
#5 Stick to a Consistent Posting Schedule
By regularly uploading videos, you stay at the forefront of your audience’s minds and increase their chances of discovering your content. So, how do you do  this exactly?
Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Start with a schedule that you can realistically manage without sacrificing quality. Whether it’s twice a week or once every two weeks, make it achievable for yourself or your team.
Planning is key, so use a content calendar to organize your ideas and ensure a smooth flow of videos.
See the below example. “Moore’s Law is Dead” channel uploads a fresh video every 3 or 4 days. That’s some serious consistency, and consistency is the secret sauce for growing fast on YouTube.
#6 Collaborate with other Content Creators in Your Niche
When you collaborate with like-minded creators, you tap into their established fan base, exposing your content to a potentially new and engaged audience. Here are some best practices for successful collaborations:
Check out the below example. It’s a collaboration between Teddy Baldassarre, a watch enthusiast, and Kevin O’Leary, the Canadian businessman and TV personality who collects expensive watches.
The great thing about this collab is that both creators are passionate about watches, so their content is engaging and valuable. And when you watch thevideo, you’ll see they’re both having a blast doing what they love.

#7 Encourage Audience Interaction with a Pinned Comment
Pinning a comment at the top of your video’s comments is like waving a flag to attract everyone’s attention. You can use it to deliver a special message or get people to take action and join the discussion.
It works because a pinned comment sticks at the top, making it much more likely for viewers to notice it.
Let’s see a greatexampleof a pinned comment that received 1.1K likes and 330+ replies.
Lastly, if you really want to boost engagement, don’t just leave the pinned comment hanging there. Reply to the comments on that pinned message. Show your audience some love and let them know you care about what they have to say.
#8 Promote Your Videos on Other Social Platforms
Promoting your YouTube videos on other social platforms is an effective strategy because it allows you to tap into a broader audience base and maximize your reach. By leveraging the existing user base on platforms like Instagram, X (previously Twitter), Facebook, and TikTok, you can attract viewers who might not have seen your content.
Here’s a detailed guide onhow to promote YouTube videos on Instagram.
We often see creators get lost when it comes to social media promotion. So, here are some things you should avoid:
#9 Incorporate Storytelling to Captivate Your Audience
When you weave a compelling story, you connect with your audience beyond just providing information. Stories trigger emotional responses and leave a lasting impact on viewers.
A well-structured narrative typically includes a beginning that hooks the audience, a middle that builds tension or presents a problem, and an ending that delivers a satisfying resolution or valuable takeaway.
Keep your storytelling concise and well-paced to maintain your viewers’ interest throughout the video. Use visuals, effects, and appropriate background music to enhance the narrative’s impact during your edit.
Imagine you’re a YouTuber discussing money management and personal finance topics. One of the logical approaches to storytelling in this niche would be sharing a personal story of overcoming debt and achieving financial freedom while mentioning the steps you took along the way. Such a narrative could inspire and motivate viewers who might be struggling with their finances.
Small Channels… Do THIS to INSTANTLY Improve YouTube Videos!
#10 Run Contests or Giveaways to Increase Engagement
Running contests on YouTube is another effective yet overlooked way to grow fast because it encourages audience engagement and participation. When people see the chance to win something valuable, they are more likely to interact with your content, like, comment, and share it with others, boosting your video’s visibility and reach.
Here’s one example: the creator offers a $5,000 prize to the contest winner.
Best Cardboard Art Wins $5,000 Challenge!
Follow these steps to get the most out of your YouTube contests:
#11 Produce Mini-Trailers for Upcoming Content
When you post teasers, viewers get intrigued and become eager to watch the long-form version when it drops. It’s all about building excitement and keeping them hooked. Plus, teasers are short and snappy, perfect for catching attention.
Add some flair to your teasers. Use visuals, cool editing, and catchy background music to set the mood. Make it impossible for viewers to look away.
Here’s an example by ASUS, an electronics company, teasing some upcoming exciting news. It got over 365K views.
Timing is key. Drop your teasers strategically before the full content release. It builds anticipation and keeps the momentum going.
And don’t forget to mention the release date of your full content in the teaser. This way, people know exactly when they can see the whole video.
#12 Improve Video Production Quality
When people watch videos on YouTube, they want to enjoy a good experience. Better video production quality means that your videos will look and sound more appealing and professional. This makes viewers more likely to stick around, watch the video, and subscribe to your channel.
How To EASILY Get More Views on YouTube!
Think about it like this: Imagine watching a blurry, shaky video with bad audio. It’s not enjoyable, right? You would probably lose interest and click away.
But if you come across a video with clear visuals, smooth camera work, and crisp audio, you’re more likely to keep watching and come back for more.
Take the time to learn about lighting, camera techniques, editing, and sound recording. As you make these improvements you’ll attract more YouTube viewers and grow fast.
#13 Host Live Streams
Unlike pre-recorded videos, live streams allow you to connect with your audience immediately as they watch, just like chatting with friends in real life.
People care about live streams because it feels more personal and authentic. They can interact with you directly by leaving comments, asking questions, or even participating in polls and games you might run during the stream.
On the other hand, live streams offer a way to cover trending topics or breaking news, making your content timely and relevant. People tend to tune in for live events because they don’t want to miss out on anything exciting happening in real-time.
#14 Embrace the Journey of Constant Improvement
This is our last recommendation for your YouTube growth. No matter how many tips you’ve followed, there’s always room for improvement. That’s why regularly testing, experimenting, and analyzing data should be a cornerstone of your content strategy.
Use TubeBuddy’sSEO Studioto optimize your videos and channels for SEO and increase your visibility. The SEO Studio checks your YouTube videos and channel. It then gives you recommendations on how to make your videos more searchable. This helps you write better titles, tags, and descriptions to ensure your videos show up higher in searches.
Finally, here are 5 questions you can ask yourself over time to refine your approach to Youtube growth:

YouTube Copyright Claim: Everything You Need to Know
As a YouTube creator, you must be aware of your responsibilities and obligations. Consequences of copyright infringement can vary on a case-by-case basis, though ignorance is no defense.
Copyright is all about the original creator owning their work, whether it’s an audio track or a video on YouTube. If a third party uses someone’s precious content without permission, the rights owner can take decisive action to protect their creativity and hard work in bringing content to the platform.
In this article, we’ll provide a detailed discussion on YouTube copyright claims and strikes, so you can navigate the YouTube world and ensure you don’t unintentionally step on anyone’s toes.
DISCLAIMER: This information is an overview of how copyright works on YouTube. Please consult a legal representative if you need advice on a specific case.

What is a YouTube Copyright Claim?
A YouTube copyright claim occurs when one party asserts that their copyrighted content, such as a video clip, image, or audio, has been used on the platform without their consent. The claiming party then has the choice to take action against this infringement and can look like the example below.
Source:https://hellothematic.com/how-copyright-works-on-youtube/
Copyright owners have full control over their Content ID policy which is YouTube’sautomated content identification system. Some creators and media publishers choose to prevent specific content, like TV and movie clips or music videos, from being uploaded to YouTube altogether.
On the other hand, some owners allow the content to remain on the uploader’s channel, but with the condition that a portion or all of the advertising revenue generated from that content goes back to the copyright owners as compensation.
Regarding a YouTube Content ID claim, the rights owner has several options to handle the violation:
YouTube has a complete guide to the optionshere.
The Impact of a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Channel
Copyright Claims have the following consequences for creators on the receiving end:
YouTube has some specific advice on what to do if you receive a copyright claim on your video, so take a few minutes to watch when you can:
How to Fix Copyright Claims from a YouTube Video
If your video receives a Content ID claim, you have the option to dispute it if you have a legitimate reason. Such reasons may include having all the necessary rights to the content in your video, using the content under a copyright exception like fair use, or believing that your video was wrongly identified or an error was made.
When you initiate a dispute for a Content ID claim, the person who made the claim (the claimant) is notified, and they have 30 days to respond. If the rights owner fails to respond within the given time frame, the Content ID claim is automatically lifted. See the below example.
Source:https://twitter.com/legaleagle/status/1478811703534096385
However, if the claimant rejects your dispute, the claim is reinstated, and you can again appeal the decision. The rights holder then has 30 days to respond. Any ad revenue held and viewing restrictions are reinstated during this process.
At this point, the rights owner has several options. They can release their claim, choose to take down the video, or opt for a “delayed takedown.”
In the case of a delayed takedown, the uploader is notified and given seven days to retract their appeal; otherwise, the video will be automatically taken down from YouTube and permanently removed.
Be aware that the claimant can submit a copyright takedown request at any stage during the dispute process. If such a request isvalid, your video will be removed from YouTube, and your channel may receive a copyright strike.
What is a YouTube Copyright Strike?
A YouTube copyright strike is a formal notice issued by YouTube to a channel owner due to violating the platform’s copyright policy. This occurs when a content creator notifies YouTube that their copyrighted material has been used without their explicit permission.
In strict adherence to copyright law, YouTube takes down the video upon receiving such a formal notification.
Source:https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1564246090748141568
Now, a video can only have one active copyright strike at a time, and it’s also possible for videos to be removed from the platform for reasons other than copyright infringement.
NOTE: Deleting a video with a copyright strike will not resolve the strike itself. The strike remains on your record as a warning, and it may have implications for your ability to monetize your content. Plus, if your active live stream gets removed due to copyright violations, you’ll face a restriction on live streaming for a period of 7 days.
Unlike claims, strikes can only be raised manually by the rights owner. There’s currently no available tool to help you automate the process.
The Impact of a Copyright Strike on Your YouTube Channel
If you ever happen to receive a copyright strike against one of your videos, you must take it seriously. The first strike can negatively affect your channel, like stopping live streaming and monetization, which we know can be problematic.
Source:https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/wnhk00/i_was_given_a_copyright_strike_for_a_private/
If you end up getting a second strike within 90 days of the first one, you won’t be able to post any new contentfor two weeks. Once those two weeks are up, Youtube will automatically restore all your channel privileges if there are no further issues.
Remember, though, each strike sticks around for 90 days from when it was issued, so it’s best to be careful and avoid copyright issues during that period.
Now, we don’t want to alarm, but if you get  three strikes within the same 90-day period, it could lead to your channel being permanently removed from YouTube. We hope it doesn’t come to that, so do your best to avoid copyright problems.
Source:https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/zua2lg/we_have_removed_your_channel_from_youtube/
The bad news is that copyright strikes can sometimes lead to legal action and court prosecution, which is something you’d obviously want to avoid. If things don’t go your way, legal bills and penalties could be expensive. So, always make sure you have the right to use any content you include in your videos.
How to Remove Copyright Strike from a YouTube Video
If you get a copyright strike, it means that a copyright owner submitted a valid legal takedown request for using their copyright-protected content.
There are three ways to resolve a copyright strike:

Difference Between YouTube Copyright Claim and Strike
How to Avoid Copyright Claims and Copyright Strikes on YouTube
Here are five tips to help you minimize the risk of YouTube copyright claims and strikes.
1. Read YouTube’s Policy on Copyright Violations
YouTube takes copyright infringement seriously and enforces strict guidelines that align with copyright laws in the USA and other jurisdictions.
The platform states, “Creators should only upload videos they have made or are authorized to use. Users should not upload videos that they didn’t make or use content in videos that someone else owns without necessary authorizations.”
The first rule of YouTube’s copyright policy is to “upload videos that creators have made or that they’re authorized to use.”
2. Create Original Content
The most effective way to avoid copyright claims is to produce your own original content. Because nobody likes a content thief, and it’s a surefire way to get hit with copyright claims.
Don’t stress if you’re not a Grammy-winning musician or a professional videographer—you don’t need fancy equipment or a top-notch studio to be original. Some of the best YouTube content comes from creators who simply use their phones or basic cameras. It’s all about the content and how you connect with your audience.
For example, use the power of your voice. That’s you talking, laughing, and sharing your thoughts. Your personality can be the magic ingredient that sets you apart from the crowd and makes your content original.
3. Understand Fair Use
Fair useis a legal approach that allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without seeking permission from the copyright owner. That said, fair use is not a one-size-fits-all solution and can be tricky to understand.
The concept of fair use aims to strike a balance between copyright protection and the rights of content creators who use copyrighted material for specific purposes. These purposes typically include criticism, commentary, news reporting, education, and parody.
So, if you’re using someone else’s copyrighted material in a way that adds value through your own insights, analysis, or creativity, you might have a fair use argument.
NOTE: Each fair use case is evaluated on its own merits, and there’s no definitive checklist to determine whether something is fair use. It’s a complex area of law, and disputes can arise even when you believe your use is fair. To reduce the risk of copyright claims, we recommend you seek permission from copyright holders for any use of their material.
4. Use Royalty-Free Music and Images
When it comes to adding tunes or visuals to your videos, royalty-free content is the way to go. Royalty-free content is a type of content that you can use without paying recurring royalties or fees for each use. It’s a budget-friendly option that can save you from potential copyright headaches.
For music, many platforms offer vast libraries of royalty-free tracks. You can find music in various genres and moods, making picking the perfect soundtrack to match your video’s vibe easy. Some of these paid platforms areEpidemic Sound,Pond5, andSoundstripe.
Regarding visuals, fortunately, many platforms offer royalty-free images that you can use for personal and commercial purposes. You can find photographs, illustrations, vectors, and more, catering to various topics and themes. Some of these platforms areUnsplash,Pexels,Vecteezy,Startup Stock Photos, andPixabay.
5. Cite Sources and Give Credit
When you use copyrighted material under fair use or with permission, try to provide proper attribution and credit to the original creators. Not only does this show respect for their work, but it also informs your audience about the source of the content.
In the video description, include the original creator’s name, the work or music’s title, and a link to the original source (if possible). See the example below.
In addition to citing sources, consider including a disclaimer that informs your audience about your fair use rights where applicable. You can state that you have used copyrighted material in accordance with fair use for purposes such as criticism, commentary, education, or parody.
Remember, while including a disclaimer is a good practice, it doesn’t guarantee 100% protection from copyright claims. Copyright holders might still dispute you, even if you believe it is fair use. But having a disclaimer can show your good faith effort to follow fair use guidelines and may help resolve disputes more amicably.
Final Takeaways on YouTube Copyright Claim
Copyright claims can impact your channel’s growth, so it’s important to respect the intellectual property of others. To avoid likely copyright claims in the future, always use original content or obtain proper permissions and give credits when using copyrighted material.

YouTube Copyright Claim: Everything You Need to Know
As a YouTube creator, you must be aware of your responsibilities and obligations. Consequences of copyright infringement can vary on a case-by-case basis, though ignorance is no defense.
Copyright is all about the original creator owning their work, whether it’s an audio track or a video on YouTube. If a third party uses someone’s precious content without permission, the rights owner can take decisive action to protect their creativity and hard work in bringing content to the platform.
In this article, we’ll provide a detailed discussion on YouTube copyright claims and strikes, so you can navigate the YouTube world and ensure you don’t unintentionally step on anyone’s toes.
DISCLAIMER: This information is an overview of how copyright works on YouTube. Please consult a legal representative if you need advice on a specific case.

What is a YouTube Copyright Claim?
A YouTube copyright claim occurs when one party asserts that their copyrighted content, such as a video clip, image, or audio, has been used on the platform without their consent. The claiming party then has the choice to take action against this infringement and can look like the example below.
Source:https://hellothematic.com/how-copyright-works-on-youtube/
Copyright owners have full control over their Content ID policy which is YouTube’sautomated content identification system. Some creators and media publishers choose to prevent specific content, like TV and movie clips or music videos, from being uploaded to YouTube altogether.
On the other hand, some owners allow the content to remain on the uploader’s channel, but with the condition that a portion or all of the advertising revenue generated from that content goes back to the copyright owners as compensation.
Regarding a YouTube Content ID claim, the rights owner has several options to handle the violation:
YouTube has a complete guide to the optionshere.
The Impact of a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Channel
Copyright Claims have the following consequences for creators on the receiving end:
YouTube has some specific advice on what to do if you receive a copyright claim on your video, so take a few minutes to watch when you can:
How to Fix Copyright Claims from a YouTube Video
If your video receives a Content ID claim, you have the option to dispute it if you have a legitimate reason. Such reasons may include having all the necessary rights to the content in your video, using the content under a copyright exception like fair use, or believing that your video was wrongly identified or an error was made.
When you initiate a dispute for a Content ID claim, the person who made the claim (the claimant) is notified, and they have 30 days to respond. If the rights owner fails to respond within the given time frame, the Content ID claim is automatically lifted. See the below example.
Source:https://twitter.com/legaleagle/status/1478811703534096385
However, if the claimant rejects your dispute, the claim is reinstated, and you can again appeal the decision. The rights holder then has 30 days to respond. Any ad revenue held and viewing restrictions are reinstated during this process.
At this point, the rights owner has several options. They can release their claim, choose to take down the video, or opt for a “delayed takedown.”
In the case of a delayed takedown, the uploader is notified and given seven days to retract their appeal; otherwise, the video will be automatically taken down from YouTube and permanently removed.
Be aware that the claimant can submit a copyright takedown request at any stage during the dispute process. If such a request isvalid, your video will be removed from YouTube, and your channel may receive a copyright strike.
What is a YouTube Copyright Strike?
A YouTube copyright strike is a formal notice issued by YouTube to a channel owner due to violating the platform’s copyright policy. This occurs when a content creator notifies YouTube that their copyrighted material has been used without their explicit permission.
In strict adherence to copyright law, YouTube takes down the video upon receiving such a formal notification.
Source:https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1564246090748141568
Now, a video can only have one active copyright strike at a time, and it’s also possible for videos to be removed from the platform for reasons other than copyright infringement.
NOTE: Deleting a video with a copyright strike will not resolve the strike itself. The strike remains on your record as a warning, and it may have implications for your ability to monetize your content. Plus, if your active live stream gets removed due to copyright violations, you’ll face a restriction on live streaming for a period of 7 days.
Unlike claims, strikes can only be raised manually by the rights owner. There’s currently no available tool to help you automate the process.
The Impact of a Copyright Strike on Your YouTube Channel
If you ever happen to receive a copyright strike against one of your videos, you must take it seriously. The first strike can negatively affect your channel, like stopping live streaming and monetization, which we know can be problematic.
Source:https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/wnhk00/i_was_given_a_copyright_strike_for_a_private/
If you end up getting a second strike within 90 days of the first one, you won’t be able to post any new contentfor two weeks. Once those two weeks are up, Youtube will automatically restore all your channel privileges if there are no further issues.
Remember, though, each strike sticks around for 90 days from when it was issued, so it’s best to be careful and avoid copyright issues during that period.
Now, we don’t want to alarm, but if you get  three strikes within the same 90-day period, it could lead to your channel being permanently removed from YouTube. We hope it doesn’t come to that, so do your best to avoid copyright problems.
Source:https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/zua2lg/we_have_removed_your_channel_from_youtube/
The bad news is that copyright strikes can sometimes lead to legal action and court prosecution, which is something you’d obviously want to avoid. If things don’t go your way, legal bills and penalties could be expensive. So, always make sure you have the right to use any content you include in your videos.
How to Remove Copyright Strike from a YouTube Video
If you get a copyright strike, it means that a copyright owner submitted a valid legal takedown request for using their copyright-protected content.
There are three ways to resolve a copyright strike:

Difference Between YouTube Copyright Claim and Strike
How to Avoid Copyright Claims and Copyright Strikes on YouTube
Here are five tips to help you minimize the risk of YouTube copyright claims and strikes.
1. Read YouTube’s Policy on Copyright Violations
YouTube takes copyright infringement seriously and enforces strict guidelines that align with copyright laws in the USA and other jurisdictions.
The platform states, “Creators should only upload videos they have made or are authorized to use. Users should not upload videos that they didn’t make or use content in videos that someone else owns without necessary authorizations.”
The first rule of YouTube’s copyright policy is to “upload videos that creators have made or that they’re authorized to use.”
2. Create Original Content
The most effective way to avoid copyright claims is to produce your own original content. Because nobody likes a content thief, and it’s a surefire way to get hit with copyright claims.
Don’t stress if you’re not a Grammy-winning musician or a professional videographer—you don’t need fancy equipment or a top-notch studio to be original. Some of the best YouTube content comes from creators who simply use their phones or basic cameras. It’s all about the content and how you connect with your audience.
For example, use the power of your voice. That’s you talking, laughing, and sharing your thoughts. Your personality can be the magic ingredient that sets you apart from the crowd and makes your content original.
3. Understand Fair Use
Fair useis a legal approach that allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without seeking permission from the copyright owner. That said, fair use is not a one-size-fits-all solution and can be tricky to understand.
The concept of fair use aims to strike a balance between copyright protection and the rights of content creators who use copyrighted material for specific purposes. These purposes typically include criticism, commentary, news reporting, education, and parody.
So, if you’re using someone else’s copyrighted material in a way that adds value through your own insights, analysis, or creativity, you might have a fair use argument.
NOTE: Each fair use case is evaluated on its own merits, and there’s no definitive checklist to determine whether something is fair use. It’s a complex area of law, and disputes can arise even when you believe your use is fair. To reduce the risk of copyright claims, we recommend you seek permission from copyright holders for any use of their material.
4. Use Royalty-Free Music and Images
When it comes to adding tunes or visuals to your videos, royalty-free content is the way to go. Royalty-free content is a type of content that you can use without paying recurring royalties or fees for each use. It’s a budget-friendly option that can save you from potential copyright headaches.
For music, many platforms offer vast libraries of royalty-free tracks. You can find music in various genres and moods, making picking the perfect soundtrack to match your video’s vibe easy. Some of these paid platforms areEpidemic Sound,Pond5, andSoundstripe.
Regarding visuals, fortunately, many platforms offer royalty-free images that you can use for personal and commercial purposes. You can find photographs, illustrations, vectors, and more, catering to various topics and themes. Some of these platforms areUnsplash,Pexels,Vecteezy,Startup Stock Photos, andPixabay.
5. Cite Sources and Give Credit
When you use copyrighted material under fair use or with permission, try to provide proper attribution and credit to the original creators. Not only does this show respect for their work, but it also informs your audience about the source of the content.
In the video description, include the original creator’s name, the work or music’s title, and a link to the original source (if possible). See the example below.
In addition to citing sources, consider including a disclaimer that informs your audience about your fair use rights where applicable. You can state that you have used copyrighted material in accordance with fair use for purposes such as criticism, commentary, education, or parody.
Remember, while including a disclaimer is a good practice, it doesn’t guarantee 100% protection from copyright claims. Copyright holders might still dispute you, even if you believe it is fair use. But having a disclaimer can show your good faith effort to follow fair use guidelines and may help resolve disputes more amicably.
Final Takeaways on YouTube Copyright Claim
Copyright claims can impact your channel’s growth, so it’s important to respect the intellectual property of others. To avoid likely copyright claims in the future, always use original content or obtain proper permissions and give credits when using copyrighted material.

YouTube Partner Program: Get In and Get Paid
YouTube isn’t just about sharing videos anymore. It’s also a great way for content creators like you, who make content people love, to make extra money while doing it. That’s where the YouTube Partner Program comes in. This program opens up the gateway to monetization, letting you turn your YouTube channel into a potential source of income.
In this article, we’ll provide you with a roadmap to navigate the ins and outs of YouTube Partner Program eligibility criteria, subscriber counts, watch hours, and all the nitty-gritty details of making that YouTube partner money.
YouTube Partner Program: The Basics
The YouTube Partner Program (YPP) allows creators to earn a share of the advertising revenue. To qualify, creators must meet certain criteria (we’ll share more on this below). This program works by sharing the earnings from ads shown on your YouTube videos. When viewers watch these ads, the money earned is divided between you, the creator, and YouTube.
Currently, creators receive55%of the ad revenue, while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. This seems like a fair deal: creators make the content, YouTube provides the platform to host that content and the audience to watch.
However, YouTube is still a business at the end of the day. To keep advertisers satisfied and continue investing in the platform, YouTube has certain requirements for joining the YPP. They want to see that you can build a subscriber base and create engaging content that keeps viewers interested. So, not every creator is eligible for the YPP.
YouTube Partner Program: What You Need to Apply
To become eligible for the YouTube Partner Program, YouTubers need to meetspecific criteriaoutlined below:
Read our blog post, “6 Ways to Generate 4,000 Hours of YouTube Watch Time FASTER!” to reach the required watch time. It’s full of advice on building watch time for your channel.
1. Get 1,000 subscribers with 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months or 1,000 subscribers with 10 million Shorts views in the last 90 days
Getting 4,000 watch hours is a major milestone on your journey to making money on YouTube. It’s not an easy feat and can take a year or even longer to achieve, but it’s worth the effort. Once you hit this goal, you can join the YouTube Partner Program and start getting a cut.
So, watch time is the total time people spend watching your videos. Every view contributes to your overall watch time count but Shorts and long-form content are counted separately. To qualify for monetization, you must reach 4,000 hours of watch time on long-form videos within 12 months. Or, you can earn 10M views on Shorts content in the past 90 days.
But hitting 4,000 watch hours or 10M Shorts views alone isn’t enough. You also need 1,000 subscribers. So whether you’re making long-form content or Shorts, you gotta turn viewers into subscribers to be monetization-ready.
2. Live in a country where the YouTube Partner Program is available
YouTube has requirements for the geographic location of their content producers, or rather, for the content producers they’ll allow to monetize on their platform.
There are a few reasons for this decision. For example, YouTube may exclude certain countries from the program because those countries have earned a reputation for fraudulent activities.
If a large number of YouTube accounts originating from a particular country are making money through fake views, YouTube might blacklist that country.
You can see thefull list of countrieswhere you can participate in the YouTube Partner Program.
3. Ensure there are no active Community Guidelines strikes on your channel
Community Guidelines are like the rulebook for how you should behave on YouTube. They apply to all sorts of content on the platform, including your videos, comments, and even your thumbnails. It’s not a complete list, but you’ll get a strike if you violate these rules. We lay it out in ourYouTube Community Guidelines Cheat Sheet.
If you get a community strike on YouTube, they’ll let you know via email and in YouTube Studio. They’ll tell you what content got removed, which specific rule was broken, and how it affects your channel. They’ll also give you some advice on what to do next.
Now, the first time you violate, it’s usually just a warning. But be careful because you’ll get a strike the next time that happens. You definitely want to avoid a strike. If you get a second strike within 90 days of the first, you’ll lose some privileges for a week. During that time, you won’t be able to upload videos, go live, or create playlists with friends. Things return to normal after the week’s up, but that strike stays on your channel for 90 days.
But if you accumulate a total of three strikes in that same 90-day period, YouTube will permanently remove your channel from the platform.
You can see the fullYouTube Community Guidelines here.
4. Have an active AdSense account linked to your channel
If you want to start making money on YouTube through the YouTube Partner Program, you’ll need to set up an AdSense account. Here’s adetailed guide on how to set up an AdSense account.
According toAdSense’s Terms and Conditions, you can only have one AdSense account under the same payee name. So, be careful not to create duplicate accounts, as it could lead to the disapproval of your new AdSense account.
Once you’ve set up your new AdSense account, it might take a couple of days to get approved and linked to your YouTube channel. So be patient, and soon you’ll be all set to receive your YouTube earnings.
How to join the YouTube partner program?
If you have reached 4,000 hours of watch time or 10M Shorts views, along with 1,000 subscribers, you’re now eligible to apply. Here are the steps to join the YouTube partner program:
Benefits of joining the YouTube partner program
1. Monetization streams
Once your application for the YouTube Partner Program is approved, various opportunities for monetization become available to you on your channel. The first one is advertising revenue. This functionality enables you to generate income by hosting placed display, overlay, and video ads throughout your channel’s content.
The second monetization method is throughchannel memberships. By offering exclusive benefits to your channel members, you can receive recurring monthly payments as a token of appreciation for their support. The great news is creators receive a generous70% of the membership revenueafter any necessary taxes and fees have been taken care of. And YouTube handles all transaction costs, including credit card fees. So you can focus on creating amazing content and not so much on the finances.
2. Content protection
Copyright infringement remains a persistent issue online, and sadly, there are people who will try to steal and reupload a YouTuber’s content.
The YouTube Partner Program employs theCopyright Match Toolto safeguard creators’ content copyrights. This tool is accessible to any YouTube user who has filed a valid copyright removal request. Once approved, the Copyright Match Tool scans newly uploaded videos on YouTube to identify potential matches with the content reported in the removal request.
But the real benefit is that for creators in the YouTube Partner Program or channels that have demonstrated a need for advanced rights management, the Copyright Match Tool additionally scans for complete reuploads of their videos on other YouTube channels.
3. Creator support team
The YouTube Partner Program allows its partners to engage with thecreator support team.
So, if you have a particular issue or want to make the best of your experience as a YouTube creator, the YouTube content support team are there to help. They can help you improve your use of YouTube, provide advice on technical or service-related matters, guide you on policy and copyright rules, address your account and channel management queries, and help you resolve Content ID and rights management concerns.
How long it takes to get accepted into the YouTube partner program?
It takes aboutone monthto get accepted into the YouTube Partner Program once you’ve met the eligibility requirements and submitted your application.
That said, there might be delays due to an unusually high number of applications. Youtube processes all YPP applications in the order they are received. Occasionally, certain channels might undergo multiple evaluations, particularly when there are differing opinions among reviewers regarding on whether a channel is eligible for the YPP. So, this could potentially extend the duration needed to reach a decision.
What to do if you get rejected from the YouTube partner program
If your request to join the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) was not approved, it means that the YouTube team of reviewers found that some part of your channel doesn’t follow YouTube’s rules and guidelines.
But don’t worry, you have another chance. If this is the first time your request has been denied, you can apply again for the YouTube Partner Program after 30 days from receiving the email about the rejection.
If you’ve been rejected before or tried to apply again previously, you can try again after 90 days of getting the rejection email. Before you apply again, make sure to check your channel for any policy violations.
Two tips to succeed in the YouTube partner program
1. Use TubeBuddy to optimize your videos
YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, with millions of users searching for content daily. Optimizing your videos for relevant keywords makes it easier for your target audience to find your content when they search for topics you cover.
Plus, videos with strong SEO are more likely to appear in YouTube’s search results and recommendation algorithms. This increased visibility can attract more viewers and subscribers to your channel.
TubeBuddy is an AI-driven YouTube SEO solution, among other things. TubeBuddySEO Studioincludes aKeyword Explorerfeature. TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer simplifies the process of finding and targeting the right keywords for success on YouTube. This tool helps you discover high-traffic keywords relevant to your niche. That way, you can see valuable keywords to focus on and enhance your videos for optimal visibility and engagement.
A standout feature of Keyword Explorer is its ability to offer complete insights into keyword volume and competition. It shows the monthly search frequency for specific keywords and assesses their ranking difficulty. This helps recognize valuable keywords to pursue while highlighting those that might be highly competitive to rank for.
2. Focus on creating original content
Original and quality content is the heart and soul of your YouTube channel. Original content gives viewers a reason to subscribe, like, and share. It makes them return for more, eagerly awaiting your next upload. What we can tell for sure is that when your audience knows they can count on you for exciting content, they’re more likely to stick around.
Original content promotes ethical and legal considerations. Using someone else’s content without proper authorization infringes upon their copyrights. This undermines the principles of innovation and can lead to legal consequences, including copyright strikes and potential lawsuits.
Optimize your YouTube success with TubeBuddy
If you’ve come this far, it means you now know how to join the YouTube partner program. Remember, it takes a mix of dedication, creativity, and of course a little digital know-how to grow your YouTube channel and make money doing what you love.
One of the tools YouTubers widely use is TubeBuddy which helps you easily optimize your videos to help them jump to the top of relevant searches with SEO Studio. Interestingly,Keyword Explorercomes with various functionalities that can assist you in evaluating how well your optimization work is paying off. It lets you keep an eye on important numbers like views, likes, and shares and see how your channel stacks up against others.

Community Guidelines are like the rulebook for how you should behave on YouTube. They apply to all sorts of content on the platform, including your videos, comments, and even your thumbnails. It’s not a complete list, but you’ll get a strike if you violate these rules. We lay it out in ourYouTube Community Guidelines Cheat Sheet.
If you get a community strike on YouTube, they’ll let you know via email and in YouTube Studio. They’ll tell you what content got removed, which specific rule was broken, and how it affects your channel. They’ll also give you some advice on what to do next.
Now, the first time you violate, it’s usually just a warning. But be careful because you’ll get a strike the next time that happens. You definitely want to avoid a strike. If you get a second strike within 90 days of the first, you’ll lose some privileges for a week. During that time, you won’t be able to upload videos, go live, or create playlists with friends. Things return to normal after the week’s up, but that strike stays on your channel for 90 days.
But if you accumulate a total of three strikes in that same 90-day period, YouTube will permanently remove your channel from the platform.
You can see the fullYouTube Community Guidelines here.
4. Have an active AdSense account linked to your channel
If you want to start making money on YouTube through the YouTube Partner Program, you’ll need to set up an AdSense account. Here’s adetailed guide on how to set up an AdSense account.
According toAdSense’s Terms and Conditions, you can only have one AdSense account under the same payee name. So, be careful not to create duplicate accounts, as it could lead to the disapproval of your new AdSense account.
Once you’ve set up your new AdSense account, it might take a couple of days to get approved and linked to your YouTube channel. So be patient, and soon you’ll be all set to receive your YouTube earnings.
How to join the YouTube partner program?
If you have reached 4,000 hours of watch time or 10M Shorts views, along with 1,000 subscribers, you’re now eligible to apply. Here are the steps to join the YouTube partner program:
Benefits of joining the YouTube partner program
1. Monetization streams
Once your application for the YouTube Partner Program is approved, various opportunities for monetization become available to you on your channel. The first one is advertising revenue. This functionality enables you to generate income by hosting placed display, overlay, and video ads throughout your channel’s content.
The second monetization method is throughchannel memberships. By offering exclusive benefits to your channel members, you can receive recurring monthly payments as a token of appreciation for their support. The great news is creators receive a generous70% of the membership revenueafter any necessary taxes and fees have been taken care of. And YouTube handles all transaction costs, including credit card fees. So you can focus on creating amazing content and not so much on the finances.
2. Content protection
Copyright infringement remains a persistent issue online, and sadly, there are people who will try to steal and reupload a YouTuber’s content.
The YouTube Partner Program employs theCopyright Match Toolto safeguard creators’ content copyrights. This tool is accessible to any YouTube user who has filed a valid copyright removal request. Once approved, the Copyright Match Tool scans newly uploaded videos on YouTube to identify potential matches with the content reported in the removal request.
But the real benefit is that for creators in the YouTube Partner Program or channels that have demonstrated a need for advanced rights management, the Copyright Match Tool additionally scans for complete reuploads of their videos on other YouTube channels.
3. Creator support team
The YouTube Partner Program allows its partners to engage with thecreator support team.
So, if you have a particular issue or want to make the best of your experience as a YouTube creator, the YouTube content support team are there to help. They can help you improve your use of YouTube, provide advice on technical or service-related matters, guide you on policy and copyright rules, address your account and channel management queries, and help you resolve Content ID and rights management concerns.
How long it takes to get accepted into the YouTube partner program?
It takes aboutone monthto get accepted into the YouTube Partner Program once you’ve met the eligibility requirements and submitted your application.
That said, there might be delays due to an unusually high number of applications. Youtube processes all YPP applications in the order they are received. Occasionally, certain channels might undergo multiple evaluations, particularly when there are differing opinions among reviewers regarding on whether a channel is eligible for the YPP. So, this could potentially extend the duration needed to reach a decision.
What to do if you get rejected from the YouTube partner program
If your request to join the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) was not approved, it means that the YouTube team of reviewers found that some part of your channel doesn’t follow YouTube’s rules and guidelines.
But don’t worry, you have another chance. If this is the first time your request has been denied, you can apply again for the YouTube Partner Program after 30 days from receiving the email about the rejection.
If you’ve been rejected before or tried to apply again previously, you can try again after 90 days of getting the rejection email. Before you apply again, make sure to check your channel for any policy violations.
Two tips to succeed in the YouTube partner program
1. Use TubeBuddy to optimize your videos
YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, with millions of users searching for content daily. Optimizing your videos for relevant keywords makes it easier for your target audience to find your content when they search for topics you cover.
Plus, videos with strong SEO are more likely to appear in YouTube’s search results and recommendation algorithms. This increased visibility can attract more viewers and subscribers to your channel.
TubeBuddy is an AI-driven YouTube SEO solution, among other things. TubeBuddySEO Studioincludes aKeyword Explorerfeature. TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer simplifies the process of finding and targeting the right keywords for success on YouTube. This tool helps you discover high-traffic keywords relevant to your niche. That way, you can see valuable keywords to focus on and enhance your videos for optimal visibility and engagement.
A standout feature of Keyword Explorer is its ability to offer complete insights into keyword volume and competition. It shows the monthly search frequency for specific keywords and assesses their ranking difficulty. This helps recognize valuable keywords to pursue while highlighting those that might be highly competitive to rank for.
2. Focus on creating original content
Original and quality content is the heart and soul of your YouTube channel. Original content gives viewers a reason to subscribe, like, and share. It makes them return for more, eagerly awaiting your next upload. What we can tell for sure is that when your audience knows they can count on you for exciting content, they’re more likely to stick around.
Original content promotes ethical and legal considerations. Using someone else’s content without proper authorization infringes upon their copyrights. This undermines the principles of innovation and can lead to legal consequences, including copyright strikes and potential lawsuits.

YouTube Thumbnail A/B Test: The Key to Killer CTR
Running a meaningful YouTube thumbnail AB test — AKA a YouTube thumbnail split test — is key to understanding which thumbnails drive traffic to your videos. Understanding which thumbnails drive traffic to your videos is key to… well, driving more traffic to your videos.
You may have heard rumblings that YouTube is working on its own YouTube thumbnail AB testing option but YouTube creators who are A/B testing thumbnails today have a clear competitive advantage. TubeBuddy YouTube A/B testing is here to help. With aTubeBuddy Legendlicense, you can start testing to find your best thumbnails today.

The Secret to YouTube CTR Success: A Killer Custom Thumbnail
The main factor for getting your videos discovered on YouTube and getting more traffic is click-through rate (CTR). And your thumbnail isdirectly relatedto your click-through rate. In other words, YouTube thumbnail A/B testing is… kinda important. And by “kinda” we mean absolutely and “important” we mean vital.
What is CTR? How can YouTube AB Thumbnail Tests Help?
CTR is the number of people who are shown your video versus the number of people who clicked through to that video.
The higher the click-through rate, the better that video will perform. YouTube will see that more people will click when they suggest it.
In a video exclusively made for TubeBuddy, creator Jessica Stansberry walks through the process of split testing a custom thumbnail to identify which one leads to more clicks on your video.
She also breaks down the importance of a killer thumbnail for a good YouTube CTR:
How to Identify the Best Custom Thumbnail for Your Video
The most crucial factor on whether or not someone clicks on a video when it is shown to them on their homepage or their subscription feed is your thumbnail. Of course, yourvideo title and descriptionplay an important role here too, but your thumbnail has the biggest impact by far on driving a higher CTR.
Picking the right thumbnail could literally make or break your video. YouTube thumbnail split testing (running YouTube video thumbnail A/B tests) helps you put your best foot forward. If you’re onTubeBuddy’s Legend Plan, you can easily identify which one of two thumbnails is outperforming the other.
How To: Split Test YouTube Thumbnails
Just upload your video in the usual way, and add a custom thumbnail. Then log into TubeBuddy, and select ‘Video A/B Testing’ from the dashboard. Then just click on ‘Create A/B Test Now’.
A new window will open, and from here, you can select which video you want to test a thumbnail for. You can run a test on a published video but also on an unlisted or scheduled video.
Once you find the video you want to do an A/B test on, TubeBuddy will ask you which kind of A/B test you want to do. This post is focused on thumbnails, but you can also A/B test your titles, tags, and descriptions too.
So, select a thumbnail and then decide how long you want to run the test.
Creator Tip:You can choose to run the test for a set amount of time. You can also tell TubeBuddy you want it to run until the statistics show that one of the thumbnails is clearly outperforming the other. You can stop YouTube thumbnail A/B test manually if you see that a winner has emerged and you don’t want to “waste” views on the lower-performing thumbnail.
Now upload the other thumbnail and hit ‘Start Test.’ TubeBuddy will automatically begin to switch out your thumbnail every 24 hours for the duration of the test.
With feedback regarding click-through rate, average view duration, watch time, and so much more, you can make an educated decision between the two thumbnails on which one is outperforming the other.
And as it’s switching out your thumbnails, TubeBuddy will also be grabbing the analytics that matter. So what does this look like in real life? Below you can see that we ran an A/B test on thumbnails for “YouTube Playlist Tutorial | Optimize playlists to EARN MORE VIEWS!”
According to the analytics, the original thumbnail (the A in A/B testing) outperformed the variation (the B in A/B testing) by 3.8%. That’s golden data for any creator.
The Value of A/B Testing for YouTubeCTR
If you want to get the maximum CTR on any given video, A/B testing is an invaluable feature that will provide data on what’s working and what can be improved. Sign up for aTubeBuddy Legend licensetoday to take full advantage of this unique tool.
Stay tuned to learn how to A/B test your titles, descriptions, and tags too. You will be fully armed with the knowledge you need to succeed.

YouTube Growth Hacks: SEO and Beyond 🚀
YouTube counts over 5 billion video views and over 1 billion hours of watch time. every. single. day.
YouTubeoutpaces Netflix and Facebookcombined in terms of watch time, which kinda putsreaching 4,000 hours of watch timefor your channel into perspective.
Capturing an audience and growing a YouTube channel can feel like a challenge because… well, it is. YouTube growth hacks can help drive new audiences to your videos, engaging viewers, and turning them into subscribers.
So, as a YouTube channel owner, how do you keep growing? How do you overcome growth plateaus? And how do you do it without spending a ton of money or buying ads? You use every YouTube growth hack you can find.
First, how do we define YouTube growth hacks? They’re tricks and ideas that are relatively simple to implement but that can yield big results. So let’s get into it.
SEO Helps you Grow on YouTube
Is SEO a YouTube growth hack? By the definition we’ve outlined above, yes… but it’s more of a YouTube best practice. If you’re saying “yeah, yeah. I know. I’m already optimizing my videos for SEO. What else you got?!” then skip ahead to the next section:Looking Outside of YouTube to Grow on YouTube
As a brand or individual video content maker, the challenge is the same. You want YouTube algorithms to recommend your videos to get your share of YouTubes over2 billion active users.
Making more quality content is always important but optimizing your videos with compelling, search engine optimized (SEO) titles, descriptions, and thumbnails is key.
TubeBuddy SEO Studiomakes this simple. This (and over 70 other TubeBuddy tools) will help you:
But as we said, optimizing your videos for search is a best practice… so let’s look at attracting viewers to YouTube videos by tapping resources outside of YouTube itself.
Look Outside YouTube to Grow on YouTube
Optimizing your stuff for search is important, but it’s not a silver bullet. What you need is an initial spike of interest that tells theYouTube algorithmthat your video is worth paying attention to.
If you’ve built any kind of audience on other channels, tap into that audience to promote your videos.
This will give your YouTube video the initial boost it needs to rank higher in YouTube and Google search.So, how can you employ the marketing channels you own to distribute your video content for larger audiences?
YouTube Growth Hack: Tapping Social Channels
Sharing your videos on social is always a good idea to drive that initial interest.
The thing is, social platforms want to keep users on their platform. Theydon’twantto send trafficto YouTube if it can be avoided. So you’ve got to play the social platform game by creating new assets to share.
Adapting your videos to each of these social platforms will help you build anomnichannel marketing approach to video distribution.That’s beneficial for a number of reasons but let’s focus on our key goal here, and that is to grow on YouTube.
Before we get to the specifics for each network, keep in mind this quick cheat sheet for aspect ratios (a big deal when it comes to video repurposing):
YouTube Growth Hacks: Tap X /Twitter
Tweets or Exes or whatever they’re called these days have a short lifespan (18 minutes). To make the most of your Twitter audience, follow Ann Smarty’s expert advice and publish at least three different tweets that go out on different days of the week, at different times.
With Twitter, you shouldn’t simply upload your video to the platform. Instead, adjust the video you want to promote in the following ways:
YouTube Growth Hacks:Face Up to Facebook
When it comes to sharing videos on Facebook, you can apply similar logic. Meta in general and Facebook specifically is perhaps the most averse to sending folks off their platform. Just posting a link to your video will get you nowhere. You need to engage people on Facebook if you hope to get them off Facebook so you can grow on YouTube.
Create micro-assets like short videos and then add a call-to-action for visiting your YouTube channel. Avoid adding links within the video itself, but rather add a call-to-action or add the link to the video within the first comment under the post.
YouTube Growth Hacks:Instant Views with Instagram
Creators can use both in-feed and Stories features to catch their Instagram audience’s attention.
Instagram has raised some of the limitations around video length, but creators still need to keep it short and sweet; people don’t go to Instagram for long-form content. Try creating short, attention-grabbing video snippets that pique the viewer’s curiosity and send them looking for your YouTube channel details (“link in bio”).Generally, you can follow previous guidelines for Twitter and Facebook, yet Instagram has a few specific matters that you need to consider as well:
Don’t forget to share your in-feed videos to Stories to tackle those who scroll through Stories but might not see your post within the feed. And if you have surpassed the 10,000 followers count, you can directly send followers from your Story to your YouTube channel by using the “swipe up” option.
YouTube Growth Hacks: Engage with Email
If you have an opted-in email list and/or if you send a newsletter, the people that subscribe to it are probably your most dedicated and active audience.
Driving email subscribers to a relevant video can do wonders for your numbers as you look to grow on YouTube.
Sending a video is not practical, but an animated gif is can work. Or share your video thumbnail with a play button and send anyone that clicks straight to your video on YouTube. It doesn’t have to be a new video… but sending traffic to a new video can help to get that early watch time that tells the YouTube algorithm that this video is interesting to people and deserves to be shared more broadly.
There are some tips and tricks tosharing videos within emails,though, as most email providers advise against embedding videos directly into your email. And this works in line with growing a YouTube channel as, instead, you can use the following techniques to send readers towards the full video on YouTube:
P.S.By integrating videos within your email marketing efforts, you don’t just promote your video, you can alsoboost open rates by 19%, increaseclick-through-rates, and evenreduce unsubscribes.
YouTube Growth Hacks:Embed on your Blog
If you have a blog, you probably have a selection of best-performing pieces that attract the highest organic traffic (or paid if you’re promoting posts on social and search).How does this help grow your YouTube channel?
You have to be careful, though, not to overload your site with heavy video content. Yes, videos can enhance the performance of your blog by increasing time on site, click-through-rates, and even conversions. Yet, if embedded incorrectly, they can also negatively affect page load speed, which is a bad SEO signal.This guidecovers all the nitty-gritty details about embedding videos to a site/blog.
YouTube Growth Hacks:Final Thoughts
There are dozens of ways you can use videos to promote and grow your YouTube channel. The more creative and experienced you get, the more overwhelming the video distribution job becomes.

YouTube Growth Hacks: SEO and Beyond 🚀
YouTube counts over 5 billion video views and over 1 billion hours of watch time. every. single. day.
YouTubeoutpaces Netflix and Facebookcombined in terms of watch time, which kinda putsreaching 4,000 hours of watch timefor your channel into perspective.
Capturing an audience and growing a YouTube channel can feel like a challenge because… well, it is. YouTube growth hacks can help drive new audiences to your videos, engaging viewers, and turning them into subscribers.
So, as a YouTube channel owner, how do you keep growing? How do you overcome growth plateaus? And how do you do it without spending a ton of money or buying ads? You use every YouTube growth hack you can find.
First, how do we define YouTube growth hacks? They’re tricks and ideas that are relatively simple to implement but that can yield big results. So let’s get into it.
SEO Helps you Grow on YouTube
Is SEO a YouTube growth hack? By the definition we’ve outlined above, yes… but it’s more of a YouTube best practice. If you’re saying “yeah, yeah. I know. I’m already optimizing my videos for SEO. What else you got?!” then skip ahead to the next section:Looking Outside of YouTube to Grow on YouTube
As a brand or individual video content maker, the challenge is the same. You want YouTube algorithms to recommend your videos to get your share of YouTubes over2 billion active users.
Making more quality content is always important but optimizing your videos with compelling, search engine optimized (SEO) titles, descriptions, and thumbnails is key.
TubeBuddy SEO Studiomakes this simple. This (and over 70 other TubeBuddy tools) will help you:
But as we said, optimizing your videos for search is a best practice… so let’s look at attracting viewers to YouTube videos by tapping resources outside of YouTube itself.
Look Outside YouTube to Grow on YouTube
Optimizing your stuff for search is important, but it’s not a silver bullet. What you need is an initial spike of interest that tells theYouTube algorithmthat your video is worth paying attention to.
If you’ve built any kind of audience on other channels, tap into that audience to promote your videos.
This will give your YouTube video the initial boost it needs to rank higher in YouTube and Google search.So, how can you employ the marketing channels you own to distribute your video content for larger audiences?
YouTube Growth Hack: Tapping Social Channels
Sharing your videos on social is always a good idea to drive that initial interest.
The thing is, social platforms want to keep users on their platform. Theydon’twantto send trafficto YouTube if it can be avoided. So you’ve got to play the social platform game by creating new assets to share.
Adapting your videos to each of these social platforms will help you build anomnichannel marketing approach to video distribution.That’s beneficial for a number of reasons but let’s focus on our key goal here, and that is to grow on YouTube.
Before we get to the specifics for each network, keep in mind this quick cheat sheet for aspect ratios (a big deal when it comes to video repurposing):
YouTube Growth Hacks: Tap X /Twitter
Tweets or Exes or whatever they’re called these days have a short lifespan (18 minutes). To make the most of your Twitter audience, follow Ann Smarty’s expert advice and publish at least three different tweets that go out on different days of the week, at different times.
With Twitter, you shouldn’t simply upload your video to the platform. Instead, adjust the video you want to promote in the following ways:
YouTube Growth Hacks:Face Up to Facebook
When it comes to sharing videos on Facebook, you can apply similar logic. Meta in general and Facebook specifically is perhaps the most averse to sending folks off their platform. Just posting a link to your video will get you nowhere. You need to engage people on Facebook if you hope to get them off Facebook so you can grow on YouTube.
Create micro-assets like short videos and then add a call-to-action for visiting your YouTube channel. Avoid adding links within the video itself, but rather add a call-to-action or add the link to the video within the first comment under the post.
YouTube Growth Hacks:Instant Views with Instagram
Creators can use both in-feed and Stories features to catch their Instagram audience’s attention.
Instagram has raised some of the limitations around video length, but creators still need to keep it short and sweet; people don’t go to Instagram for long-form content. Try creating short, attention-grabbing video snippets that pique the viewer’s curiosity and send them looking for your YouTube channel details (“link in bio”).Generally, you can follow previous guidelines for Twitter and Facebook, yet Instagram has a few specific matters that you need to consider as well:
Don’t forget to share your in-feed videos to Stories to tackle those who scroll through Stories but might not see your post within the feed. And if you have surpassed the 10,000 followers count, you can directly send followers from your Story to your YouTube channel by using the “swipe up” option.
YouTube Growth Hacks: Engage with Email
If you have an opted-in email list and/or if you send a newsletter, the people that subscribe to it are probably your most dedicated and active audience.
Driving email subscribers to a relevant video can do wonders for your numbers as you look to grow on YouTube.
Sending a video is not practical, but an animated gif is can work. Or share your video thumbnail with a play button and send anyone that clicks straight to your video on YouTube. It doesn’t have to be a new video… but sending traffic to a new video can help to get that early watch time that tells the YouTube algorithm that this video is interesting to people and deserves to be shared more broadly.
There are some tips and tricks tosharing videos within emails,though, as most email providers advise against embedding videos directly into your email. And this works in line with growing a YouTube channel as, instead, you can use the following techniques to send readers towards the full video on YouTube:
P.S.By integrating videos within your email marketing efforts, you don’t just promote your video, you can alsoboost open rates by 19%, increaseclick-through-rates, and evenreduce unsubscribes.
YouTube Growth Hacks:Embed on your Blog
If you have a blog, you probably have a selection of best-performing pieces that attract the highest organic traffic (or paid if you’re promoting posts on social and search).How does this help grow your YouTube channel?
You have to be careful, though, not to overload your site with heavy video content. Yes, videos can enhance the performance of your blog by increasing time on site, click-through-rates, and even conversions. Yet, if embedded incorrectly, they can also negatively affect page load speed, which is a bad SEO signal.This guidecovers all the nitty-gritty details about embedding videos to a site/blog.
YouTube Growth Hacks:Final Thoughts
There are dozens of ways you can use videos to promote and grow your YouTube channel. The more creative and experienced you get, the more overwhelming the video distribution job becomes. But with the right tools like TubeBuddy andWave.video, you can focus on YouTube SEO and video promotion strategies available at your fingertips to get tangible results without allocating large advertising and marketing budgets into your efforts.

Links in YouTube Shorts: What Changes Mean for Creators
Links in YouTube Shorts are changing. On Aug 31, 2023, viewers won’t be able to tap or click on any links shared in YouTube Shorts descriptions, comments, or in the vertical live feed.
Our own Judah Lee has the full scoop on changes to links in YouTube Shorts. See below for thevideo transcript.
Changes Coming to Links in YouTube Shorts
YouTube is making this change to make it harder for scammers and spammers to do what scammers and spammers do. Legit YouTube content creators will need to adjust their link sharing strategy.
To compensate for the lack of live links in YouTube Shorts, Youtube is rolling out a new feature to channel pages and, spoiler alert, creators should get used to saying “linkin bioon channel page”
Beginning Aug 23, 2023, creators will have a new option to add “prominent, clickable links” to their channel pages. Creators can add multiple links that are in line with theYouTube Community Guidelines. These links will be displayed just above the subscribe button on the channel page.
This is a great opportunity for YouTube creators to update their channel page and turn it into asubscriber magnet.
Links in YouTube Shorts to Long-Form Videos
These changes mean no more links in YouTube Shorts directing viewers to your long-form content. For now, there’s no easy way around this limitation for creators. However, YouTube promises that “by the end of September, we’ll start introducing a safer way for creators to direct viewers from Shorts to their other YouTube content.”
What Should YouTubers Do to Prepare for Changes to Links in YouTube Shorts?
🚨 BREAKING: YouTube Shorts UPDATE In 3 Weeks (New Changes) – Video Transcript
There are updates coming to YouTube on August 23rd and 31st.
These updates are going to bring big changes to YouTube chores and your YouTube channel page. Here’s what you need to know.
YouTube Shorts get over 50 million video views daily. Most of them are great videos from legitimate creators. However, mixed among those legitimate videos are spammers and scammers who just love to wreck things. They flood YouTube shorts with countless reuploads of the identical video. These reuploads are accompanied by links that lure viewers to deceptive websites that promise a lot but take everything.
Just the other day, my own grandmother was almost taken victim. Luckily I was there but this is serious.
Effective. August 31st YouTube shorts comments and descriptions will no longer support hyperlinks. They’re going away along with clickable social media icons from all desktop channel banners. Now, I know those scammers are pissed that their nasty little links aren’t gonna work anymore. Their little YouTube operation is over with. However, I’m not gonna lie. This comes with some pretty nasty side effects for us creators.
All those helpful links that you use to direct viewers to social media accounts, sponsored sites, affiliate pages, even those links that drove traffic to other videos of yours. Yeah, those are going to and will be replaced with non clickable text.
Yeah, I I know that’s not ideal but there are two more updates that make this change a little bit better. First off on August 23rd YouTube is adding prominent clickable links to everybody’s channel page on mobile and desktop near the subscribe button. When viewers click, they will see up to 12 websites that the creator chose to add that also comply with YouTube’s community guidelines.
The benefit is that viewers can see the link to the destination before clicking and YouTube is able to monitor these links for spam and abuse far better than the unimaginable amount of comments and descriptions containing spam links.
Now, what about all those links that you already pinned to direct viewers to more of your shorts, long form videos? This is where something really cool is happening. YouTube has another big update: you’ll be able to connect your short to another short or long form video or live stream within YouTube studio. The result is a clickable title above the caption that looks like this.
Now, this is different from the edit into a short feature that YouTube dropped last year. That feature allowed you to trim a moment from a long form video into a short that included the same design. However, this new feature allows you to link any public upload from your channel to a newly custom created short. This update is going to be here by the end of September. But for us creators who have already pin links in our shorts to other videos, we’re gonna have to go back and manually update those.
It is what it is. I know some of this is kind of annoying, but I do think it makes YouTube a better platform. I also think that this new linking feature bridges the gap from shorts to long form much better. Let me know what you think in the comments below.
And since we’re talking about shorts, I thought I’d tell you that recently we released a tool called suggested shorts that will analyze all of your long form videos to find the most engaging moments that you can clip, use as inspiration or reedit into a short for your channel. I played around with it and had some incredible results. I will leave a link for you in the description and right here so you can check that out. Thanks for hanging out with me and keep creating.

YouTube Content Calendar: How to Make Your Own
Do you need a YouTube content calendar? If you don’t already know the next few videos you’re going to film then yes, you do.
As a YouTube creator, you know that consistency is key to getting recommended by theYouTube algorithm, which is key to getting and maintaining your4,000 hours of watch timeand turning viewers into subscribers.
A good YouTube content calendar helps when inspiration is hard to come by. Being intentional about creating and maintaining your YouTube content calendar means you’ll never be at a loss for what to film next.
At its most basic, a content calendar is a running list or ideas and topics for your YouTube videos. You can create a content calendar with pen and paper, in a spreadsheet, a to-do list, or using any number of online or offline task management tools.
With TubeBuddy Video Topic Planner, you can research keyword opportunities, do competitor research, and plan out video topics that are sure to drive that all-important watch time.
Get Video Topic Planner
Video Topic Planneris available to all TubeBuddy users;TubeBuddy Freeusers can research and save five topics,TubeBuddy ProandTubeBuddy Legendusers get unlimited access to topic planning tools.
Benefits of a YouTube Content Calendar
Creating a content calendar or roadmap may sound scary, but some of the benefits to you as a creator include peace of mind and being able to release videos in sequential order or series.
For instance, if you’re a technology channel talking about the latest iPhone, you can publish a video of the unboxing, then how to set up the iPhone, the favorite apps you use, and so on. Knowing what order you’d like to film the videos makes it easier for you to plan your content.
Plan Your YouTube Content Calendar with TubeBuddy
TubeBuddy has a great tool available for content planning to anyone with a license. OurTopic Planneris for you if:
There are several ways to add ideas to your Topic Planner – all from within our suite of tools. First, click Video Topic Planner from the main TubeBuddy Menu dropdown to open this dashboard:
You can start adding topic ideas immediately or access our Keyword Explorer feature directly from this dashboard. We’ve covered how to do the bestkeyword researchwith TubeBuddy, but here is a quick overview.
Click on ‘Launch Keyword Explorer’ to open a new dashboard. You can either search trending topics to see what’s red hot on YouTube right now. The What’s Trending section is broken down by country, which is a great option to identify what’s happening across your region.
This can be a valuable way to leverage tent-pole events or current affairs to create content. It’s a way to tie recent events into whatever your channel is about and see if you can marry the two.
An additional way to find more topics for your Video Topic Planner is to do a quick Google search for a national holiday calendar or weird, quirky holiday calendar for your genre. For example, typing “4th of July” into the search bar brings up a ton of data on that U.S. celebration of independence:
The term “4th of July” has a very high search volume but is highly competitive and may be almost an impossible target to rank highly for if you’re a new or small channel. However, you can dig into Related Searches to find a topic around July 4th that viewers are searching for but don’t have as much competition as the main keyphrase. You can also keep refining your search using the search box.
“4th of July cupcakes” looks a great bet and could be a winning topic that deserves a spot in the YouTube content calendar for a cooking or family-focused channel.
Just save it to the Topic Planner when you’ve found an idea. You can even add notes about the video and what you can do with the content!
Don’t forget to go back through your old content to identify any videos you can update with a different spin or new information.
If you have a well-performing video published at a specific time of the year, check if it’s a video that might be worth remaking.
For instance, if just before Christmas last year, you published a “best gifts for teenage girls under $50” type of video that performed well for you, it may be content that is worth remaking this year.
Log this and all your other ideas in your YouTube content calendar.

YouTube Content Calendar: How to Make Your Own
Do you need a YouTube content calendar? If you don’t already know the next few videos you’re going to film then yes, you do.
As a YouTube creator, you know that consistency is key to getting recommended by theYouTube algorithm, which is key to getting and maintaining your4,000 hours of watch timeand turning viewers into subscribers.
A good YouTube content calendar helps when inspiration is hard to come by. Being intentional about creating and maintaining your YouTube content calendar means you’ll never be at a loss for what to film next.
At its most basic, a content calendar is a running list or ideas and topics for your YouTube videos. You can create a content calendar with pen and paper, in a spreadsheet, a to-do list, or using any number of online or offline task management tools.
With TubeBuddy Video Topic Planner, you can research keyword opportunities, do competitor research, and plan out video topics that are sure to drive that all-important watch time.
Get Video Topic Planner
Video Topic Planneris available to all TubeBuddy users;TubeBuddy Freeusers can research and save five topics,TubeBuddy ProandTubeBuddy Legendusers get unlimited access to topic planning tools.
Benefits of a YouTube Content Calendar
Creating a content calendar or roadmap may sound scary, but some of the benefits to you as a creator include peace of mind and being able to release videos in sequential order or series.
For instance, if you’re a technology channel talking about the latest iPhone, you can publish a video of the unboxing, then how to set up the iPhone, the favorite apps you use, and so on. Knowing what order you’d like to film the videos makes it easier for you to plan your content.
Plan Your YouTube Content Calendar with TubeBuddy
TubeBuddy has a great tool available for content planning to anyone with a license. OurTopic Planneris for you if:
There are several ways to add ideas to your Topic Planner – all from within our suite of tools. First, click Video Topic Planner from the main TubeBuddy Menu dropdown to open this dashboard:
You can start adding topic ideas immediately or access our Keyword Explorer feature directly from this dashboard. We’ve covered how to do the bestkeyword researchwith TubeBuddy, but here is a quick overview.
Click on ‘Launch Keyword Explorer’ to open a new dashboard. You can either search trending topics to see what’s red hot on YouTube right now. The What’s Trending section is broken down by country, which is a great option to identify what’s happening across your region.
This can be a valuable way to leverage tent-pole events or current affairs to create content. It’s a way to tie recent events into whatever your channel is about and see if you can marry the two.
An additional way to find more topics for your Video Topic Planner is to do a quick Google search for a national holiday calendar or weird, quirky holiday calendar for your genre. For example, typing “4th of July” into the search bar brings up a ton of data on that U.S. celebration of independence:
The term “4th of July” has a very high search volume but is highly competitive and may be almost an impossible target to rank highly for if you’re a new or small channel. However, you can dig into Related Searches to find a topic around July 4th that viewers are searching for but don’t have as much competition as the main keyphrase. You can also keep refining your search using the search box.
“4th of July cupcakes” looks a great bet and could be a winning topic that deserves a spot in the YouTube content calendar for a cooking or family-focused channel.
Just save it to the Topic Planner when you’ve found an idea. You can even add notes about the video and what you can do with the content!
Don’t forget to go back through your old content to identify any videos you can update with a different spin or new information.
If you have a well-performing video published at a specific time of the year, check if it’s a video that might be worth remaking.
For instance, if just before Christmas last year, you published a “best gifts for teenage girls under $50” type of video that performed well for you, it may be content that is worth remaking this year.
Log this and all your other ideas in your YouTube content calendar.
For more information about the Topic Planner, click on ourYouTube playlistfor examples and walk-throughs.

How to Find the Best Title + Description for your YouTube Videos with A/B Testing
The best title, thumbnail, and description for a YouTube video drives people to click. But whatisthe best YouTube title? How does a creator experiment without tanking their watch time.
The best YouTube title drives video click-through rate (CTR), which in turn drives watch time, subscribes, and every other YouTube metric that matters… in other words, it’s important.
YouTube Watch Time: Learn How A/B Testing Can Increase It
We’ve covered howA/B testing custom thumbnailscan boost that all-important watch time. In this post, we will show you how to split test your titles, descriptions, and tags too!
Before we jump into A/B testing, let’s talk about how crafting the best title for YouTube videos can take a video from poorly viewed to amust-watch.
What Is the Best Title for YouTube Videos
Crafting the best video title is part art, part science:
A/B Test with TubeBuddyto Find the Best Title for YouTube Videos
The title is the first place the biggest channels and the top YouTube creators look to make a change if their video is not performing. They take every opportunity to maximize the impact of the title, to increase CTR and to get the YouTube algorithms to take notice.
With aTubeBuddy Legend Plan, you can perform unlimited A/B tests on your videos to find the best possible title (andthumbnail,tags,description, etc.)
What is A/B Testing?
A/B testing (AKAsplit testing) is simply a way to compare two versions of something to determine which performs better. In an A/B test, two or more versions of a variable (thumbnail, title, etc.) are shown to audiences to determine which version has the most impact. That version is crowned the winner and replaces the lower-performing variant.
How to A/B Test YouTube Titles in TubeBuddy
On YouTube, log into TubeBuddy, and select ‘Video A/B Testing’ from the dashboard dropdown. Then just click on ‘Create A/B Test Now.’ A new window will open, and from here, you can select which video you want to test a title for.
Once you find the video you want to do an A/B test on, TubeBuddy will ask you which kind of A/B test you want to do. This post is focused on titles, tags, and descriptions, so we’ll select the ‘Metadata Test’:
Next, choose to run the test for a set number of days or until the results are statistically significant. Then, click continue until you see the ‘Original Title/Test Title’ page. Here, upload your alternative title next to the original. If you only want to test a new title, keep scrolling through the pages until you reach the ‘Ready to Start?’ window. Now just click on ‘Yes, Start the Test,’ and TubeBuddy AI will take care of the rest.
What to Expect from TubeBuddy’s A/B Testing Reports
If you want to test a different title or description, or perhaps a different link in your description box, you can do that, and we can track your results for you.
Go back to the main ‘A/B Testing’ home page and select the video you are running the test on. A new window called ‘A/B Test Status’ will open to give you all the needed details.
If you want a quick overview, just check the left-hand column for the overall scores on your test, as well as recommendations.
The right-hand side of the reports drills down on some specific metrics that have surfaced because of the test. These include:
If the overall score is very narrow, you can use these more specific metrics to inform your decision whether to keep the original title or pick the new one.
TubeBuddy A/B Testing Tips for YouTube Creators
TubeBuddy AI makes A/B testing your metadata or thumbnails a piece of cake, there are some best practices to know if you want to succeed with this feature.
Change One Element at a Time
For best A/B testing results (that will get you to that best title for your YouTube video faster) it’s important to only test one variable at a time. If you change the title, thumbnail, and tags simultaneously, it’s going to be hard to pinpoint which of those changes made a difference.
Pick the Best Test Conditions
TubeBuddy’s default time for an A/B test is 14 days, but you can easily change that and choose a shorter time range. If you select the statistical significance option, the time range could be anywhere from a couple of days to many, many weeks. Choose the best option for you to get the best results.
Know the Test Limitations
As aTubeBuddy Legend, there’s no limit on how many tests you can run on your titles, descriptions, or thumbnails per month, or in total. However, you there is a limit of ten A/B tests running at any given time.
That could mean you are running four tests on different thumbnails for four separate videos, plus four title tests for four other videos, and then two description tests.
As your tests finish (depending on the time limits requested), you can create more A/B tests.
Schedule A/B Tests for the Future
As you’re setting up your A/B test, you’ll see that you can schedule it for a future date. This will be helpful if your publishing date is also in the future. You can run a test on a published video as well as on unlisted and scheduled videos.
Why A/B Testing is an Invaluable Tool for Creators
There are many variables that dictate a given video’s success on YouTube. Some are outside the creators’ control but most are not. So, as the saying goes, control the controllables. Paying attention to the details, like A/B testing to find the best title for a YouTube video, can pay dividends.
A/B testing custom thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and tags can put you back in control of theCTRyour content attracts. And as you know, increased CTR leads to higher views!
WithTubeBuddy Legend, you can A/B test every element of your videos, and the insights you draw will inform your creator strategy going forward.

Do ASMR YouTubers Make Money? Can I?!
Do ASMR YouTubers make money? Some certainly do!
For most YouTube creators, making money starts with building an audience, monetizing your YouTube channel, and always being on the lookout for other revenue generation opportunities. ASMR content is no different.
Before we get into how ASMR YouTube creators make money, let’s define ASMR. ASMR stands forautonomous sensory meridian response. It’s a phenomena that many people report as a feeling of tingling, often starting in the scalp and traveling through the body. It’s a low-grade euphoria brought on by certain sounds or sights.
On YouTube and elsewhere, ASMR is a content niche filled with creators trying to induce this response in viewers with sounds and images. For example, ASMR creators might speak in a whisper, pop bubble wrap, run a makeup brush across their microphone to try to elicit an ASMR response.
Some ASMR videos rack up millions of views.Gibi ASMRis among the best known ASMR creators. Their channel is monetized and is closing in on 2 billion views with around 4.75 million subscribers. So do ASMR YouTubers make money? Yes, but it’s a competitive niche. Here are some ways ASMR YouTubers make money.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
How do ASMR YouTubers Make Money?
Monetize Their ASMR Channel
Once you hit the YouTube monetization thresholds — and as a creator who follows theYouTube Community Guidelines— you can get a cut of revenue generated from ads around your videos. This is the key for most creators togenerateincome on YouTube.
Tomonetize your channel, you must have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months or 10 million YouTube Shorts views over the past three months.
Create Sponsored Content
If your ASMR channel has a big enough and engaged enough audience, you might be able to work with advertisers and publishers to make sponsored content for their brand.
In other words, getting paid to make content that showcases a brand’s products or services.
Whatever content niche you’re in, don’t forget that sponsored content has to be clearly labelled as such, according toFTC disclosure rules.
Jump on Patreon
ASMR is a unique content category and creators Patreon is a site where fans, or “patrons,” can give money to support their favorite creators on a regular basis. With a loyal ASMR channel following, creators can open a Patreon account, offering exclusive content or other perks to patrons in exchange for their ongoing support.
Selling Merch
Merchandise sales are another another way ASMR YouTubers make money. Offering t-shirts, mugs, hats, or other branded merchandise. You could manufacture and sell your own stuff using a site likeSpring(formerlyTeespring) orPrintful. The key tomaking money with merchis finding the products the audience responds to and getting creative with what you offer.
How do ASMR Creators Make Money with Donations?
ASMR YouTube content requires the audience to fall into a quiet, relaxed state. Ads or sponsorships that interrupt ASMR content are antithetical to that goal. Some ASMR creators will ask for audience donations, either instead of or along with other revenue-generating ideas.
Use a service like PayPal, Cash App, Venmo, or other options to accept donations, and include a donation button in your video and channel description.
Do ASMR YouTubers Make Money?
Again, some do. Every creator’s journey is different but regardless of the content niche, making money on YouTube takes time, dedication, and effort. It starts with building an audience and great content, and taking every opportunity togrow your YouTube channel.

Tomonetize your channel, you must have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months or 10 million YouTube Shorts views over the past three months.
Create Sponsored Content
If your ASMR channel has a big enough and engaged enough audience, you might be able to work with advertisers and publishers to make sponsored content for their brand.
In other words, getting paid to make content that showcases a brand’s products or services.
Whatever content niche you’re in, don’t forget that sponsored content has to be clearly labelled as such, according toFTC disclosure rules.
Jump on Patreon
ASMR is a unique content category and creators Patreon is a site where fans, or “patrons,” can give money to support their favorite creators on a regular basis. With a loyal ASMR channel following, creators can open a Patreon account, offering exclusive content or other perks to patrons in exchange for their ongoing support.
Selling Merch
Merchandise sales are another another way ASMR YouTubers make money. Offering t-shirts, mugs, hats, or other branded merchandise. You could manufacture and sell your own stuff using a site likeSpring(formerlyTeespring) orPrintful. The key tomaking money with merchis finding the products the audience responds to and getting creative with what you offer.
How do ASMR Creators Make Money with Donations?
ASMR YouTube content requires the audience to fall into a quiet, relaxed state. Ads or sponsorships that interrupt ASMR content are antithetical to that goal. Some ASMR creators will ask for audience donations, either instead of or along with other revenue-generating ideas.
Use a service like PayPal, Cash App, Venmo, or other options to accept donations, and include a donation button in your video and channel description.
Do ASMR YouTubers Make Money?
Again, some do. Every creator’s journey is different but regardless of the content niche, making money on YouTube takes time, dedication, and effort. It starts with building an audience and great content, and taking every opportunity togrow your YouTube channel.

YouTube Brand Partnership Deals: Read This Before You Sign
You want to land YouTube brand partnership deals, but you don’t want to compromise your content, your audience, or all the hard work you put into building your channel.
YouTube brand partnership deals are a great way tomonetize your content. Looking to put yourself out there to secure a brand deal? Has a brand approached you looking to build a relationship? Either way, there are some important things that every creator needs to consider.
YouTube Brand Partnership Deals are a Big… Deal
As your YouTube presence grows, so will your access to YouTube brand partnership deals. TheBENlabs Creator Communitycan help get you on brand’s radars earlier.
Remember that a partnership is a give-and-take. Authenticity is the key for good YouTube brand partnership deals. That means alignment around not just audience but mission, and values too.
A good deal benefits all involved; it’s not just about giving a brand access to your audience, it should benefit you as well by supplementing your income. The ideal YouTube brand partnership deal gives creators resources to support fresh new content, meaning audiences win too.
But good things don’t often come easy; problems can arise in YouTube brand partnership deals. It’s important for creators to be mindful of who they partner with.
Creators and brands needs to match on values, not just on audience. Creators deserve both brand support and fair compensation. A good YouTube brand partnership deal doesn’t just further the brand’s goals, it also respects the creator’s craft.
Consider these three questions and you increase your chances of finding the right YouTube brand partnership deal for you, and you avoid potentially harmful partnerships:
Does the Brand Align with Your Values?
In order to ensure a brand is the right fit for you, ask yourself if you would support the brand outside of a partnership. Do you already love their products? Do you support their mission? If it’s an easy yes, that’s great. If the answer is no, it’s probably not the right YouTube brand partnership deal for you. Repping a brand you don’t believe in will be inauthentic and jeopardizes not just your reputation but the brand’s reputation too.
No body wants that.
For example, technology company and smartphone makerHuawei partnered with Gal Gadotfor the release of one of their phones in 2018. But when the actress promoted the new device, Twitter snitched and revealed that the tweet actually came from an iPhone. The result was bad press for both parties.
Similarly,Scarlett London was under firewhile repping Listerine. She shared a heavily staged promotional photo of her morning, with tortillas posing as pancakes, and a bottle of Listerine in the background. Criticism around the lack of authenticity in the post and the nature of reality vs. the sanitized social feed was fair. The vitriolic pile-on, including death threats against the influencer, was not.
These are extreme examples but they illustrate the larger point. Taking YouTube brand partnership deals that reflect your interest and experience is the key to authenticity. Authenticity is the key to great content where everyone wins; brand, creator, and audience.
Does the Brand Take Creator Safety Seriously?
In arecent study, 95% of creators reported experiencing hate or harassment at one point in their career. This kind of negativity that is, unfortunately, par for the course. Not everyone is going to love your content, not everyone is going to appreciate you monetizing your content with YouTube brand partnership deals.  Of that 95%, only half felt that they had appropriate resources to deal with the situation.
Creators, especially those who are new to brand collaborations, deserve to have the support of their partners to alleviate the burden of negative comments and help guide them through this new stage of their career.
WhenYouTube launcheditsCreator Safety Center, it did so to monitor and address hateful comments and harassment. That’s great, but things are bound to slip through the cracks. A trustworthy brand keeps a close eye on paid content from their creators and is quick to step in to remove comments or offer support if things take a turn for the worse.
Even before content is posted, brands should be working with creators to align on content and ensure that the content being shared isn’t something that could get creators in trouble. Floyd Mayweather was hit with a$300,000 fineafter promoting a crypto company that ended up being a scam.
The point is, you should never post anything you’re uncomfortable with, and a good brand partner won’t ask you to.
Do the research: how does a brand treat creators it engages for YouTube brand partnership deals? How have their brand partnership deals ended in the past? Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.
Will You Be Compensated Fairly for a YouTube Brand Partnership Deal?
Audience size is the biggest determining factor in creator compensation for any YouTube brand partnership deal. All creators — whethernanoormicroormega— deserve fair compensation.
Some creators may be content with getting free product but more likely, creators are unsure of how to ask for more. Even if you have a small niche following, the value you offer to a brand looking to engage with that audience has value and you deserve fair compensation.
Prior to entering negotiations, have a clear idea of what you would like to get out of the deal. Start by thinking strategically about your rate. Stay up to date on shifting trends by connecting with creator peers in communities liker/NewTuberson Reddit.
Consider 2% to 10% of your total following as a range for your base rate. For example, if you have 50,000 followers, 2% would make your base rate $1,000). From there, you can make adjustments that fit each deal.
New York-based creatorCece Xierecommends adjustingbased on the level of engagement you have from your audience or more variable factors like your credibility in the industry or how much you need the extra income. Similarly, wellness creatorAlexis Barberrecommends adding chargesdepending on specific deal terms. For example, if a brand wants exclusivity, she would add 50% to the original cost.
Prioritizing your interests can be difficult when you really want to land a YouTube brand partnership deal. Be firm and respectful. Know your value as a content creator and don’t settle.
The Best YouTube Brand Partnership Deals
When all is said and done, good YouTube brand partnership deals are just that — a partnership.
You deserve to benefit from your hard work, and the kinds of brands that make great partners understand and respect that. In the same vein, brands deserve to be presented authentically and in the best light, and the content creators that make great partners ensure that’s what happens.
Now go out there and land that perfect YouTube brand partnership deal for you and your audience.

For example, technology company and smartphone makerHuawei partnered with Gal Gadotfor the release of one of their phones in 2018. But when the actress promoted the new device, Twitter snitched and revealed that the tweet actually came from an iPhone. The result was bad press for both parties.
Similarly,Scarlett London was under firewhile repping Listerine. She shared a heavily staged promotional photo of her morning, with tortillas posing as pancakes, and a bottle of Listerine in the background. Criticism around the lack of authenticity in the post and the nature of reality vs. the sanitized social feed was fair. The vitriolic pile-on, including death threats against the influencer, was not.
These are extreme examples but they illustrate the larger point. Taking YouTube brand partnership deals that reflect your interest and experience is the key to authenticity. Authenticity is the key to great content where everyone wins; brand, creator, and audience.
Does the Brand Take Creator Safety Seriously?
In arecent study, 95% of creators reported experiencing hate or harassment at one point in their career. This kind of negativity that is, unfortunately, par for the course. Not everyone is going to love your content, not everyone is going to appreciate you monetizing your content with YouTube brand partnership deals.  Of that 95%, only half felt that they had appropriate resources to deal with the situation.
Creators, especially those who are new to brand collaborations, deserve to have the support of their partners to alleviate the burden of negative comments and help guide them through this new stage of their career.
WhenYouTube launcheditsCreator Safety Center, it did so to monitor and address hateful comments and harassment. That’s great, but things are bound to slip through the cracks. A trustworthy brand keeps a close eye on paid content from their creators and is quick to step in to remove comments or offer support if things take a turn for the worse.
Even before content is posted, brands should be working with creators to align on content and ensure that the content being shared isn’t something that could get creators in trouble. Floyd Mayweather was hit with a$300,000 fineafter promoting a crypto company that ended up being a scam.
The point is, you should never post anything you’re uncomfortable with, and a good brand partner won’t ask you to.
Do the research: how does a brand treat creators it engages for YouTube brand partnership deals? How have their brand partnership deals ended in the past? Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.
Will You Be Compensated Fairly for a YouTube Brand Partnership Deal?
Audience size is the biggest determining factor in creator compensation for any YouTube brand partnership deal. All creators — whethernanoormicroormega— deserve fair compensation.
Some creators may be content with getting free product but more likely, creators are unsure of how to ask for more. Even if you have a small niche following, the value you offer to a brand looking to engage with that audience has value and you deserve fair compensation.
Prior to entering negotiations, have a clear idea of what you would like to get out of the deal. Start by thinking strategically about your rate. Stay up to date on shifting trends by connecting with creator peers in communities liker/NewTuberson Reddit.
Consider 2% to 10% of your total following as a range for your base rate. For example, if you have 50,000 followers, 2% would make your base rate $1,000). From there, you can make adjustments that fit each deal.
New York-based creatorCece Xierecommends adjustingbased on the level of engagement you have from your audience or more variable factors like your credibility in the industry or how much you need the extra income. Similarly, wellness creatorAlexis Barberrecommends adding chargesdepending on specific deal terms. For example, if a brand wants exclusivity, she would add 50% to the original cost.
Prioritizing your interests can be difficult when you really want to land a YouTube brand partnership deal. Be firm and respectful. Know your value as a content creator and don’t settle.
The Best YouTube Brand Partnership Deals
When all is said and done, good YouTube brand partnership deals are just that — a partnership.
You deserve to benefit from your hard work, and the kinds of brands that make great partners understand and respect that. In the same vein, brands deserve to be presented authentically and in the best light, and the content creators that make great partners ensure that’s what happens.
Now go out there and land that perfect YouTube brand partnership deal for you and your audience.

How to Make Money on YouTube: Ten Strategies to Make Bank
How to make money on YouTube shouldn’t be the first question a would-be creator need to ask themselves. However, earning revenue from the content you create and the views and subscribers you attract might be what keeps you going as a content creator.
While you have to be in theYouTube Partner Programto qualify for AdSense and get paid for the ads that appear around your videos, there are many other ways a creator can generate income. Let’s dive into the different options:
#1 Ad-Revenue Share from the YouTube Partner Program
Generating revenue from ads run against your content is one of the accessible ways for creators to earn money from YouTube. Applying to join theYouTube Partner Program(YPP) is a milestone in monetizing your content.
There are a few hoops for creators to jump through before they qualify. Still, those goals themselves are all important on your YouTube journey anyway, so if you meet the criteria, you may as well start to earn an income from the content you’d be creating regardless. To join the YouTube Partner Program, creators must meetsix requirements:
If you hit all six goals, you can take the following steps to apply to the YPP and enable monetization on YouTube:
To get an idea of your predicted or potential YouTube revenue, in your YouTube dashboard:
YouTube keeps a 45% share of ad revenue, which means creators get 55% of revenues generated from ads around their videos.
#2 Super Chat
If creators go live on YouTube, they have an opportunity to use theSuper Chatfeature to monetize that live stream. Viewers can purchase a Super Chat message with a credit or debit card during the stream. Once that payment has been processed, YouTube will highlight that viewer’s message on the live chat screen.
If you have Super Chat turned on, viewers will see a dollar bill symbol on the chat screen. A slider will appear if they click on this button, offering the chance to donate a dollar amount to the creator.

Enthusiastic viewers can donate anything from $1 to $500 per day (up to $2,000 per week) or the equivalent in their local currency. YouTube keeps about 30% of the money earned from a Super Chat donation.
For more information about setting up and benefiting from the Super Chat feature, you’ll need to be over 18 and live in a location where it is available.
#3 Super Stickers
Super Stickersallow viewers to pay to use a particular image to appear on a YouTube live stream chat. There is a range of designs available that fans can purchase that cover gaming, music, fashion and beauty, food, and other genres.
Super Stickersare also available to creators already using the Super Chat feature. The feature is live in 4 languages across 60 countries. The Stickers come in a range of price points, from 99 cents to $50. YouTube keeps 30% of each donation.
#4 Super Thanks
Turning to your viewers can be a solid strategy for how to make money on YouTube. Just like Super Chat and Super Stickers,Super Thanksis also a way for fans to “tip” their favorite YouTube video creators and another way for YouTubers to monetize their content. However, viewers can use the feature on videos that have been uploaded rather than live streamed.
Super Thanks is available to all channels in the YouTube Partner Program. Sixty-eight regions, including the U.S, the U.K, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Greece, Brazil,  India, and South Korea have access to the additional viewer donation option.
#5Make YouTube Shorts
YouTube Shorts rake in50 billion viewsevery day. It took a while but today, creators canmonetize YouTube shortsto get a cut of ad revenues. Before this update in early 2023, the only option creators had was to try to get some support from the $100MYouTube Shorts Fund.
To qualify for YouTube Shorts monetization, a channel must meet the following criteria:
#6 How to Make Money on YouTube Premium
YouTube Premium offers a better viewing experience with ad-free videos, offline playback, the option to continue playing audio with your phone screen off, and more. Ads on YouTube are how most creators make money on YouTube so while it sounds pretty good for viewers, it doesn’t sound so great for creators. Fear not: creators can still make money on YouTube even if YouTube Premium users aren’t seeing ads around their videos.  It can also generate income for creators
The platform compensates for the loss of potential AdSense revenue by sharing viewers’ monthly membership fees with creators. Learn more about how YouTubeensures creatorsstill make money on YouTube from YouTube Premium users.
#7 Channel Memberships
Channel Memberships are tailor-made for creators to leverage their subscribers and fans. You can create a space to reward those viewers and subscribers who sign up with exclusive content and other membership perks.
Memberships are available at different prices, so fans can pay whatever they can afford or feel is appropriate. The minimum starting price is $4.99 per month, while the maximum a creator can charge is $49.99 per month. As with AdSense, YouTube will deduct 30% of your overall revenue. Learn more about the benefit ofChannel Membershipsfor both the creator and the user:
#8 Merch Sales
Some creators make money on YouTube by… making moneyoffYouTube by selling merchandise, AKA merch. Merch can include branded hoodies, t-shirts, water bottles, mugs, tote bags, key chains, or anything that fits with the creator’s brand and that viewers want to buy. Merch can be a great way to make money on YouTube.
It pays to plan out your merchandise strategy before investing in any product and certainly before using any service to manufacture and sell merchandise on your behalf. We spoke with four industry expertsabout the steps to take for a successful merchandise strategy. Take their advice, and you’ll be off to a winning start.
#9 Brand or Sponsorship Deals
Sponsorships or Partnerships mean a brand or publisher wants to work with a creator directly on content that promotes a product or service.
Making money on YouTube with brand deals really comes down tobuilding an engaged audience on YouTube. There aren’t really any shortcuts to doing this, though there are some“hacks” that help.
Authenticity is everything in a brand deal; you worked hard to build an audience, inauthentic content jeopardizes that audience. For a successful brand deal, the creator needs to be a good fit for the brand but it’s at least as important that the brand is a good fit for the creator.
Nano and micro creatorscan land a brand sponsorship deals early in their YouTube journey. Even before they qualify for theYouTube Partner Program. However, smaller creators won’t command the big money that a channel with 1M+ subscribers might.
#10 Affiliate Sales
Affiliate marketing is a self-directed approach to getting paid for promoting products. As an affiliate, creators will have a custom link that tracks activity (visits, product sales, etc.) that your content drove. Many online products, services, and stores have an affiliate program. Most will require the content creator to qualify first. Applying to be an affiliate is a bit of admin work but it can be a great way for savvy creators to make money on YouTube.
For example, you may create a video around a specific gaming console, then provide an Amazon affiliate link in your description box directing to that product. You get a small commission if a viewer clicks on your link and buys the console.

Amazon is a great place to start with affiliate marketing because anybody can apply and be accepted into the program. Just be aware that, as with any business transaction, there arerules to follow, but for the most part, they are a pretty easy target for most people to hit. Read our extensive guide to theAmazon affiliate program for YouTube creatorsto learn more.
So there you have it. 10 ways to make money on YouTube. The best advice for any YouTube creator looking to make money on the platform is this: Consider your YouTube as a business from the very beginning of your creator journey. This little mindset shift will help to set you up for financial success.

YouTube SEO: How to SEO YouTube Content with TubeBuddy SEO Studio
YouTube SEO is key to getting your content seen. Finding the right keywords is step one (TubeBuddyKeyword Explorercan help there). Optimizing your content to target those keywords is next. That’s where TubeBuddySEO Studiocomes in.
SEO Studio takes a step-by-step approach to optimizing your video title, video description, and tags so that YouTube search and other search engines know exactly what to make of it. When it’s done well, YouTube SEO can send viewers in droves.
After doing all the creative work to produce amazing content, that content needs to be easy for viewers to find in search or they’ll never find it. Optimizing your content for YouTube SEO is vital, and SEO Studio makes it easy.
SEO Studio is another good reason to upgrade from a free TubeBuddy account toTubeBuddy Legend.
How to Find SEO Studio in TubeBuddy
Make sure you’re signed in to your TubeBuddy account on YouTube to access the tool. Just open the dashboard and select SEO Studio from the TubeBuddy drop-down dashboard located in the top right corner.

If you’re aPro, or Legend license holder, you have full access to this feature.
How to Optimize YouTube SEO with SEO Studio
Once you found the perfect keyword to target, that’s where SEO Studio really comes into its own. Let’s show you how.
Clicking on SEO Studio will open a dashboard for the tool. The first thing to do is to type in your target keyword (in our case, ‘low fat vegan chocolate cake.’) Click START to… start.
A new window will instantly show you an SEO score for any term you typed in. In our example, ‘low fat vegan chocolate cake’ scores 62%. 62% isn’t terrible, but YouTube SEO demands better.
TheSEO Studioworkflow will help you get that score into the 90s or better with tips and recommendations, and easy YouTube SEO tips to optimize your title, description, and tags. As you make changes, you’ll see your SEO YouTube score increase.
On the right-hand side of the SEO Studio workflow, you’ll see the steps you need to take to improve your YouTube SEO ranking. Opportunities for improvement are highlighted in pink. We’re going for all green here.
SEO YouTube Best Practices
SEO Studio steps creators through all the important SEO YouTube best practices such as:
The key with SEO (YouTube and other search engines) is to include your optimizations while using natural language. In other words, to write for humans, optimize for computers. In SEO Studio, you’ll see tips in pink advising you to include your target keyword naturally in the title and include partial matches of your target keyword in the description. So let’s do that to see how much that changes our SEO score:
Just by following the instructions in the tool, our score has shot up to a near-perfect 95%. By choosing a key phrase with relatively low competition, these simple YouTube SEO efforts could shoot us to the top of the rankings. We just need to give it some time.
Click next to open the Tags tab. The tool is suggesting tags to use, and by adding them to our actual tag window, we’ve hit 99%. Not bad for a few minutes work!
Clicking Next will open the Thumbnails dashboard. A compellingcustom thumbnail is vital because it can boost your click-through rate, one of the most important metrics for visibility and discoverability.
Thumbnails Matter for SEO on YouTube
The tool will present a series of thumbnails for the top videos ranking for your chosen keyword. Just upload yours to compare as we did. SEO Studio liked our thumbnail. That’s good. If it didn’t, we could useTubeBuddy Thumbnail Generatorto create a better optimized thumbnail to drive more clicks.
Once you’ve made every YouTube SEO improvement you can and you’re happy with the results, just click Next and TubeBuddy will take care of the rest.
YouTube SEO is important when you’re uploading new videos, but don’t sleep on your older videos. Taking a little time to optimizing existing videos with SEO Studio can give your channel a real boost.
SEO Studio will also let you experiment with new titles, descriptions, tags, and thumbnails on published videos. If you’re editing an existing video, you can apply the changes directly to the video via YouTube Studio. Just run your suggestions through the tool first to get the highest score you can.

YouTube SEO: How to SEO YouTube Content with TubeBuddy SEO Studio
YouTube SEO is key to getting your content seen. Finding the right keywords is step one (TubeBuddyKeyword Explorercan help there). Optimizing your content to target those keywords is next. That’s where TubeBuddySEO Studiocomes in.
SEO Studio takes a step-by-step approach to optimizing your video title, video description, and tags so that YouTube search and other search engines know exactly what to make of it. When it’s done well, YouTube SEO can send viewers in droves.
After doing all the creative work to produce amazing content, that content needs to be easy for viewers to find in search or they’ll never find it. Optimizing your content for YouTube SEO is vital, and SEO Studio makes it easy.
SEO Studio is another good reason to upgrade from a free TubeBuddy account toTubeBuddy Legend.
How to Find SEO Studio in TubeBuddy
Make sure you’re signed in to your TubeBuddy account on YouTube to access the tool. Just open the dashboard and select SEO Studio from the TubeBuddy drop-down dashboard located in the top right corner.

If you’re aPro, or Legend license holder, you have full access to this feature.
How to Optimize YouTube SEO with SEO Studio
Once you found the perfect keyword to target, that’s where SEO Studio really comes into its own. Let’s show you how.
Clicking on SEO Studio will open a dashboard for the tool. The first thing to do is to type in your target keyword (in our case, ‘low fat vegan chocolate cake.’) Click START to… start.
A new window will instantly show you an SEO score for any term you typed in. In our example, ‘low fat vegan chocolate cake’ scores 62%. 62% isn’t terrible, but YouTube SEO demands better.
TheSEO Studioworkflow will help you get that score into the 90s or better with tips and recommendations, and easy YouTube SEO tips to optimize your title, description, and tags. As you make changes, you’ll see your SEO YouTube score increase.
On the right-hand side of the SEO Studio workflow, you’ll see the steps you need to take to improve your YouTube SEO ranking. Opportunities for improvement are highlighted in pink. We’re going for all green here.
SEO YouTube Best Practices
SEO Studio steps creators through all the important SEO YouTube best practices such as:
The key with SEO (YouTube and other search engines) is to include your optimizations while using natural language. In other words, to write for humans, optimize for computers. In SEO Studio, you’ll see tips in pink advising you to include your target keyword naturally in the title and include partial matches of your target keyword in the description. So let’s do that to see how much that changes our SEO score:
Just by following the instructions in the tool, our score has shot up to a near-perfect 95%. By choosing a key phrase with relatively low competition, these simple YouTube SEO efforts could shoot us to the top of the rankings. We just need to give it some time.
Click next to open the Tags tab. The tool is suggesting tags to use, and by adding them to our actual tag window, we’ve hit 99%. Not bad for a few minutes work!
Clicking Next will open the Thumbnails dashboard. A compellingcustom thumbnail is vital because it can boost your click-through rate, one of the most important metrics for visibility and discoverability.
Thumbnails Matter for SEO on YouTube
The tool will present a series of thumbnails for the top videos ranking for your chosen keyword. Just upload yours to compare as we did. SEO Studio liked our thumbnail. That’s good. If it didn’t, we could useTubeBuddy Thumbnail Generatorto create a better optimized thumbnail to drive more clicks.
Once you’ve made every YouTube SEO improvement you can and you’re happy with the results, just click Next and TubeBuddy will take care of the rest.
YouTube SEO is important when you’re uploading new videos, but don’t sleep on your older videos. Taking a little time to optimizing existing videos with SEO Studio can give your channel a real boost.
SEO Studio will also let you experiment with new titles, descriptions, tags, and thumbnails on published videos. If you’re editing an existing video, you can apply the changes directly to the video via YouTube Studio. Just run your suggestions through the tool first to get the highest score you can.

How to Avoid Copyright Music and Copyright Strikes on YouTube
How to avoid copyright music on YouTube is a big question for creators, and it’s the best way to avoid a dreaded copyright strike on Youtube. After all, copyright law is a bit of a grey area on the Internet, and creators often don’t know they’ve violated copyright until they get acontent strike.
So when can a YouTube creator use copyright music? What are the rules around using copyright music in content? What constitutes “fair use?” And how do we avoid a copyright strike on YouTube?
YouTube creators might turn toYouTube’s own audio library, but if they’re trying to catch the latest audio trend, they have to use copyright music. So the question might not be “how to avoid copyright music on YouTube,” but rather “when can I use copyright music on YouTube?” Let’s see if we can’t answer both of those questions.
This post discusses the legal implications of using copyrighted music in your videos. We also highlight some of the biggest myths about copyright and music.
We are not lawyers. This is not legal advice. We hope you’ll find our research into copyright music and audio interesting and informative, but it’s no substitute for a good copyright attorney.

Music Copyright 101: What Audio Can You Use and When
The easiest way to not violate copyright and avoid a copyright strike on YouTube and is to create 100% original content. But what about using sound effects or a soundtrack in your video? The most important question is, “Am I inhibiting the original creator’s ability to earn money from this work?” Whether or not the creator is making money from their work, you are not allowed to do anything that might inhibit their ability to do so.
Examples would include using a track from a Taylor Swift album as the audio background in a video. How to avoid a copyright strike on YouTube? Don’t do that! If someone could listen to the track via your video, or even rip the audio from your video, you’re inhibiting the original creator’s ability to earn money from their work.
If you’re new to creating videos and want to know the basics of copyright concerning music, YouTube has an excellent overview that is definitely worth watching to bring you up to speed and should help you avoid a copyright strike on YouTube:
So When is it OK to Use Another Creator’s Music in Your Video?
It’s a complicated topic, but if you want to use music that someone else has created, you’ll need to know the legal implications. Obtaining permission depends on the specific piece itself and whether it needs a license or not. Let’s break it down:
Works in the public domain:the only time that you don’t need to secure special permission to use a work is when that work is in thepublic domain. Public domain (PD) is itself a complex topic but basically, it’s stuff where copyright has expired or where copyright didn’t apply in the first place.
If what you are using isn’t in the public domain, you WILL need to obtain a license to use it. The more formal the license, the more protected you are when using it. Also, keep in mind that many recordings have copyright for the song and the recording of the song itself. In that case, you will actually need to obtain two licenses.
Royalty-free music is still free to use, but it is not in the public domain:there is a distinct difference between them. You still need permission to use royalty-free recordings. Generally, these are afforded as blanket permissions.
Music: The Difference Between Sharing and Stealing
There is a genuine difference between sharing someone’s musical composition and taking the same track and using it solely for your benefit. Let’s take a look at both approaches:
Is Performing a Cover Version of a Song Copyright Violation?
Sad to say but it probably is. Whether or not the copyright would be enforced is the real question here. The number of people covering songs on YouTube suggests that’s unlikely. Of course, it’s a lot more complicated than that, but acoveris your artistic interpretation of somebody else’s work by its very nature. Some ways to avoid a copyright violation here include:
What Will Happen if I Use Copyrighted Work in My YouTube Video?
At best, nothing will happen, but if you start making money from a piece of work that uses copyright music, that can change quickly. One major determining factor is whether or not you’re making money using the copyrighted work. If so, you’re bound to catch the attention of somebody who wants their cut. Some other things that could occur:
Fortunately, copyright on YouTube isn’t the black hole it once was; creators can get a glimpse of the site’s action against a video that uses copyrighted music as part of its soundtrack.
ContentID: How YouTube Determines a Copyright Violation
YouTube has a sophisticated copyright tracking system called ContentID. It is an automated system that matches your content against a database of copyrighted material. If the system flags your video, you’ll be notified and you’ll be able to dispute the flag. Your content maybe demonetized or blocked if you don’t appeal or if you appeal and lose.
Here’s more fromContentIDfrom YouTube itself:
The catch here is that, even if you created a unique and original video, that doesn’t mean it will necessarily pass ContentID checks.
Did you use stock audio from your editing program? That music may only be approved for personal use, and uploading it to YouTube and monetizing it, that approval no longer applies.
When asking how to avoid copyright music on YouTube, the best thing to do is to always check the usage rights before you post content that includes something from a third-party source.
What is “Fair Use?” and How Can a Creator Benefit From It?
‘Fair Use’ is a set of exceptions that limit the power behind copyright when another person’s use of a piece of work is considered “fair.” Many of the guidelines surrounding fair use are governed by theDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we encourage you to look at their policies.
Fair use is the ultimate gray area. It’s not clear or directive when it comes to how to avoid copyright music on YouTube — or at least, how to avoid violating copyright guidelines with your YouTube videos. That said, there are a few rules from section 107 of the DMCA can help you determine if what you are doing is fair use:
Biggest Myths about Copyright, Music, and Video
So, now that we’ve looked at some of the biggest concerns regarding copyright, music, and video, let’s look at some of the biggest myths surrounding the topic. This should clear up any questions you may have or give you the extra knowledge you need as a video creator:
Nobody has contacted me, so I must not be violating their copyright.
Copyright can be difficult to detect, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t being violated. The longer you benefit from somebody else’s copyright, the harsher the penalty could be when you are discovered.
My work is just a fan video, so I’m covered.
This one is a little complicated: Maybe but not necessarily. The type of use is critical, but not the only way to determine if copyright has been violated. This could fall underfair use, discussed above.
The only time you have a nearly fool-proof chance to monetize these works is if it’s a parody. Comedy, and specifically criticism, is heavily protected by US laws.
I didn’t enable ads on/monetize my video, so it’s fair use.
Making money from a copyright work is the most obvious violation, but just because you’re not trying to cash in doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. The original copyright holder may still be able to force a takedown of your material, evenifit’s being used within the bounds of the law. That said, if you haven’t made money with the work, you can avoid a lawsuit.
I didn’t see a copyright notice, so it must not have one.
Think again. Everything created in the US and other major countries is copyrighted and protected immediately, with no action required by the creator. A notice may increase the strength of that copyright and the damages received in the case of a violation, but absence of a copyright notice doesn’t mean absence of copyright.
I found it in the public domain(the internet is public domain, right?)
The internet is public, but that doesn’t make everything on the internet public domain. Far from. Just because you found it on the internet doesn’t mean you’re safe to use it.
I wrote a disclaimer in the description crediting the artist and claiming I had no intention to violate copyright laws.
If only it were that simple. It’s not. If you violate copyright laws, saying that wasn’t your intent changes nothing. Crediting artists (including other creators) who inspire you is right, but it does nothing to change copyright laws.
How to avoid copyright music on YouTube comes down to having a basic understanding of copyright laws. Hopefully, we’ve been able to provide that for you.
Still, copyright is complex and nuanced with room for interpretation. For deeper insight or advice on specifics, you’ll want to speak to an attorney.

Enable YouTube Super Chat and Super Stickers to Monetize Live Streams
When you enable Super Chat on YouTube, you unlock a new revenue stream for your livestream content. The same goes when you enable Super Stickers on YouTube.
Before we get into how to enable Super Chat and Super Stickers on YouTube, let’s talk a little about why you might want to, what’s required of you as a creator, and how much you can expect to make.
What is Super Chat on YouTube?
YouTubeSuper Chatis a feature forlivestream contentonly. Super Chat lets viewers reward creators for their efforts, sort of like a tip.
If you have Super Chat turned on, viewers will see a dollar bill symbol on the chat screen during your livestream. If they click on this button, a slider will appear, inviting them to choose a dollar amount to donate to the creator (that’s you).
Viewers can pay to highlight their message using their debit or credit card. Once that’s done, their message will get special treatment.
The higher the donation, the longer that viewer’s comment stays pinned and highlighted at the top of the live chat. They can also use more characters in their message. See this example from our ‘International Creator Day Celebration’ live stream.
A Super Chat comment appears in a different color from other messages, so it pops out on the screen. Paid messages, including the amount donated, are visible to any viewer tuned into the live stream.
Super Chat is not available if live chat is turned off.
How to Enable Super Chat on YouTube
Any creator that meets the criteria (below) will find the option to enable this feature on YouTube in YouTube Studio.
YouTube Super Chat is available to all creators who:
If that’s you, all you need to do is turn it on.
How to Enable YouTube Super Chat
Once you’ve gone through the process, you’ll see the new option available the next time you live stream. However, this feature is not available on age-restricted or “Made for Kids” content.
How Much Will I Make with YouTube Super Chat?
It’s impossible to say how much a given YouTube creator will make with YouTube. Variables include but certainly aren’t limited to:
Enthusiastic viewers can donate anything from $1 up to $500 per day, capped out at $2,000 a week, adjusted for the viewer’s local currency.  YouTube takes about 30% of a each donation.
Generate Extra Revenue with YouTubeSuper Stickers
Stickers allow viewers to pay to use a special image to appear in a live stream chat. There’s a range of designs that fans can choose that cover gaming, music, fashion and beauty, food, and more.
The stickers are also available to anyeligiblecreators already using the Super Chat feature. They are active across 60 countries in at least four languages, but you’ll need to enable them in YouTube Studio. To enable Super Chat, just follow the instructions above.
As with Super Chat, viewers can purchase these stickers using their debit or credit card. It’s important to note that any purchase is non-refundable.
The Stickers come in a range of price points, from 99 cents to $50. YouTube keeps 30% of each donation.
How to Attract Super Chat and Super Stickers from Fans
Since viewers can spend up to $500 per day on Super Chat and up to $100 a day on Super Stickers, it’s an excellent way for creators to generate additional income from top fans.
Both features are squarely aimed at viewers who want to show their support for, and connect with, their favorite creators.
If you have a small channel, you may not reap the rewards of those donations just yet, but if you aim to build a solid and engaged audience, it’s certainly possible. Get more information straight from YouTube:

How to Grow on YouTube – 16 Tips
Before we get into how to grow on YouTube, let’s talk a little about why you’ll want to.
YouTube is thesecond largest search engine, just behind Google. It goes without saying that getting traction on the platform can give you a huge audience reach and have a positive impact on your business.
But how do you build a presence on YouTube? Let’s dive into 16 tips you should follow to give yourself the best chance of quickly growing your YouTube channel.

How to Grow on YouTube – Table of contents
1. Have a Clear Channel Focus
A clear direction for your channel is step one in how to grow on YouTube. This applies to the topic(s) you will focus on with your channel and the kinds of videos that will make up the bulk of your content too.
YouTube users are much more likely to subscribe to a channel that has a clear and consistent offering than they are to one that seems to jump from topic to topic without an obvious direction.
2. Brand Your Channel
If you want to make a lasting impression on visitors to your channel, you need to make it look good. Here are the simple steps to do just that:
3. Create With Your Audience in Mind
If you’re just having a bit of fun with your videos, then by all means create content for yourself. If how to grow on YouTube is the question though, you need to create content that your target audience are interested in, and in formats they enjoy consuming too.
Of course, this takessome research, and it might require a bit of trial and error to work this out too, but once you find a winning formula for you and your audience double down on it.
4.Discover What People Are Searching For
The best way to find winning topics is to see what people are already searching for on YouTube.  TubeBuddy’skeyword explorer toolcan give you some great insights on the search volume of keywords, related keywords, and the competition levels too. All essential elements for picking the right topics.

Extract Tags from YouTube Videos with View and Copy Video Tags
When you extract tags from YouTube videos, you can build out your own highly targeted tag list.
Maybe you want to use some of the same video tags as your main competitor on YouTube, or maybe you’re looking to mine your own videos to ensure you’re using tags consistently. Whatever the case, TubeBuddyView and Copy Video Tagsis the best way to extract tags from YouTube videos.
With TubeBuddy View and Copy Video Tags, creators can easily optimize their YouTube video tags, extract video tags from YouTube videos and save them to a list, and even see which tags competitors are using and ranking for.
Why YouTube Video Tags are Important
Tags are an important part of SEO; optimizing your YouTube videos to be found by The Algorithm. Tags are not themost important factor; YouTube looks at title, then description, then tags in that order. Still, top three. Tags are key to how videos are categorized on YouTube and optimizing YouTube video tags for your content is important.
Tagged videos are more likely to be recommended to viewers when they watch a video with similar tags. Whether you’re creating #makeup tutorials, #speedruns of your favorite game, or spending a #survival weekend in the forest, you have to tag your videos.
Moreover, viewers can click on tags to explore related content. These are high intent viewers who are looking for something specific. Properly tagging your videos ensures you show up in searches, and increases your chances of adding a subscriber if your channel is the one that gives them what they’re looking for.
Tags are also cumulative; they build your brand as a creator. By consistently using relevant tags across your videos, you position yourself as an expert in your field or topic.
So yes, YouTube tags are important. YouTube gives creators up to 500 characters to use for tagging. For creators, the more relevant tags you include, the better.
The Ideal Tags for Your Videos
The ideal tags for your video arehigh volumeterms that arerelevantto your content. High volume meaning a lot of people are looking for videos on the topic. Relevant meaning your video relates to the topic.
It can be tempting to stuff in the most searched tags in the hopes of showing up in more searches. That is not a winning strategy. Using wildly irrelevant tags can actually fall afoul ofYouTube Community Guidelinesarounddeceptive practices.
Extract Tags from YouTube Videos
With theTubeBuddy extensioninstalled, opening any YouTube video will display the Videolytics view to the right. If it’s your video, you’ll see the tags you’re currently targeting. If it’s a competitor’s video, you’ll see the tags they use.
In either case, click on “Copy To” to save these tags to a new list in TubeBuddy.
The best practice is to have a few different tag groups for the different topics you cover in your content. There can certainly be cross-over between these tag lists. For example, if your channel topic is camping and outdoors, you might have a tag list that relates to gear reviews, or survival tips, or camping recipes. You’ll want your top-level tags (e.g. #outdoors, #camping, etc.) in all your tag lists. Add more topic-specific tags (e.g. #camping recipe, #smores etc.) below.
Choosing the Right Tags for Your Videos
TubeBuddySEO Studiooffers a ton of YouTubeSEO optimization toolsthat increase your chances of ranking in relevant searches.
When creating a new video on YouTube, you’ll see Recommended Tags appear below the video description field. Here, you can sort by:
With TubeBuddy Tag Tools, you can easily extract tags from YouTube videos and save them to a list. Use your tag list to apply tags consistently across all your videos to build credibility and subject matter expertise.
Tip:Add a Target Keyword in TubeBuddy Tag Tools to make Recommended Tags more relevant
Optimize Existing Video Tags
Uploading new videos and including relevant tags is important. However, a little time spent optimizing tags (as well astitlesanddescriptions) for older videos can pay dividends.
Open any of your existing videos in YouTube Studio and go down to theTagssection. Here you’ll see which tags you have applied to your video. UnderRecommended Tags, highlightingSearch Trafficwill show you how many views a given tag has received. Sort byRelevance,Keyword Score, andSearch Traffic, and add high-performing, high-search tags to your video by clicking Copy underTag Tools. If you run out of space (YouTube allows 500 characters for tags), remove low performing or less relevant tags and replace them with better ones.
Video Tags is one small but important part of the YouTube search engine optimization tools available in TubeBuddy. Paired withKeyword Explorer,SEO Studio,Click Magnet, and other TubeBuddy tools, you give your videos the best chance of being found. You drive that all-importantwatch time. With quality content, youturn viewers into subscribers.
And that’s what it’s all about. Right?

So yes, YouTube tags are important. YouTube gives creators up to 500 characters to use for tagging. For creators, the more relevant tags you include, the better.
The Ideal Tags for Your Videos
The ideal tags for your video arehigh volumeterms that arerelevantto your content. High volume meaning a lot of people are looking for videos on the topic. Relevant meaning your video relates to the topic.
It can be tempting to stuff in the most searched tags in the hopes of showing up in more searches. That is not a winning strategy. Using wildly irrelevant tags can actually fall afoul ofYouTube Community Guidelinesarounddeceptive practices.
Extract Tags from YouTube Videos
With theTubeBuddy extensioninstalled, opening any YouTube video will display the Videolytics view to the right. If it’s your video, you’ll see the tags you’re currently targeting. If it’s a competitor’s video, you’ll see the tags they use.
In either case, click on “Copy To” to save these tags to a new list in TubeBuddy.
The best practice is to have a few different tag groups for the different topics you cover in your content. There can certainly be cross-over between these tag lists. For example, if your channel topic is camping and outdoors, you might have a tag list that relates to gear reviews, or survival tips, or camping recipes. You’ll want your top-level tags (e.g. #outdoors, #camping, etc.) in all your tag lists. Add more topic-specific tags (e.g. #camping recipe, #smores etc.) below.
Choosing the Right Tags for Your Videos
TubeBuddySEO Studiooffers a ton of YouTubeSEO optimization toolsthat increase your chances of ranking in relevant searches.
When creating a new video on YouTube, you’ll see Recommended Tags appear below the video description field. Here, you can sort by:
With TubeBuddy Tag Tools, you can easily extract tags from YouTube videos and save them to a list. Use your tag list to apply tags consistently across all your videos to build credibility and subject matter expertise.
Tip:Add a Target Keyword in TubeBuddy Tag Tools to make Recommended Tags more relevant
Optimize Existing Video Tags
Uploading new videos and including relevant tags is important. However, a little time spent optimizing tags (as well astitlesanddescriptions) for older videos can pay dividends.
Open any of your existing videos in YouTube Studio and go down to theTagssection. Here you’ll see which tags you have applied to your video. UnderRecommended Tags, highlightingSearch Trafficwill show you how many views a given tag has received. Sort byRelevance,Keyword Score, andSearch Traffic, and add high-performing, high-search tags to your video by clicking Copy underTag Tools. If you run out of space (YouTube allows 500 characters for tags), remove low performing or less relevant tags and replace them with better ones.
Video Tags is one small but important part of the YouTube search engine optimization tools available in TubeBuddy. Paired withKeyword Explorer,SEO Studio,Click Magnet, and other TubeBuddy tools, you give your videos the best chance of being found. You drive that all-importantwatch time. With quality content, youturn viewers into subscribers.
And that’s what it’s all about. Right?

YouTube Community Guidelines Cheat Sheet
YouTube Community Guidelines govern what is and is not allowed on the world’s most popular video platform. They detail how the platform deals out “strikes” for violating theguidelines, the rules for being a creator on the platform, and rules around what is and isn’t allowed YouTube channels, includingmonetized channels.
Anyone canbecome a video creatorand publish content on YouTube. Creators have total freedom to make the kind of content they want to create. It’s not a free-for-all though. The community guidelines aim to keep offensive, incendiary, or otherwise problematic content off the platform, and details how and when content may be removed, or a channel deactivated.
These guidelines target bad actors. That’s not you (right?!) but every YouTube creator needs to be aware of the rules they lay out.
YouTube Community Guidelines: What Creators Need to Know
The YouTube Community Guidelinestl;drdown to “be honest and be cool.”
Be Honest
Be Cool
Should you be worried about violating YouTube’s Community Guidelines? Yes. Should you be scared that the hammer could fall on your channel at any moment? Probably not.
That said, repeated rule breaking has serious consequences, including the loss of your channel. That’s the last thing you want, especially if it’s generating any kind of revenue for you. YouTube will come down on you like a ton of bricks if you publish content that is:
YouTube makes it very clear what it considers a violation. As a creator, you should take the time toreview the guidelines, and note that they don’t just apple to video content but to titles, thumbnails, livestreams, playlists, and comments.
Three YouTube Community Guidelines Strikes and You’re Out
YouTube has a three strikes policy. That’s good. As a creator, you don’t want any strikes at all, but at least  accidentally falling afoul of the community guidelines doesn’t mean you’re finished as a YouTube creator.
As a first step, YouTube will typically remove or un-publish the offending content and send a warning. Take this warning seriously and address the issue to avoid getting a YouTube strike.
Not always though: if a channel or video is a clear violation of the community guidelines, YouTube can (and has) delete a channel outright without any warning. This is only an issue for channels that aren’t honest or cool, asdefined above.
First Community Strike
If you get a warning for violating the YouTube community guidelines and you don’t address the issue, your channel will receive itsfirst strike. If you get a strike, YouTube will put limits on your channel for seven days, during which you can’t:
After seven days, you’ll be back in good standing, but the strike will remain on your channel for 90 days.
Second Community Strike
Apparently one strike didn’t get the message across.
Your first strike will expire after 90 days. However, if you violate the YouTube community guidelines again before the 90 days are up, you’ll get asecond strike. That’s not good.
With a second strike, you’re barred from posting any content for two weeks. The strike will expire after 90 days after which point, YouTube (and your friends here at TubeBuddy) really hope you’ve taken the lesson — and the YouTube community guidelines — to heart.
Third Community Strike
OK, seriously?! Did you even read the YouTube community guidelines?
This is really bad. If you get three strikes, you’rebanned from YouTube. Your channel and all your videos are permanently deleted. Presumably, you were not beinghonestorcool, which is not cool (or honest).
YouTube doesn’t want you on its platform anymore.
YouTube Community Guidelines: Understanding Strikes
There was a time when getting a community strike on YouTube raised more questions than it answered. Fortunately, YouTube updated its guidelines process and now provides detailed information about what caused each violation. It will also confirm to the creator any possible repercussions on the visibility and monetization of the content in question.
This videohelps to explain the process.
Stay on the Right Side of the Rules
Hopefully you’ll never see a community strike on your account… but it can happen. The key is to take the lesson, re-read the YouTube community guidelines, make the appropriate changes, and continue on your content journey unperturbed.

18 Killer Tips for Optimizing Your YouTube Videos For Search
YouTube is thesecond largest search enginein the world. The five or 10 minutes you’ll spend optimizing your YouTube videos for search can be the difference between racking up views or living in obscurity.
It’s called Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and it’s how search engines know what your content is all about.
It’s the quality of your content that keeps people engaged and racking up that all-importantwatch time, But it’s SEO that helps your channel and your videos get found.
Showing up in YouTube search results is vital. Showing up in Google Search is even better. In either case, keyword research and optimizing your YouTube videos for search engines is key.
TubeBuddy SEO Studiomakes it easy to optimize your YouTube videos for search. Made by creators, for creators, it offers helpful tips and automations for everything fromcontent ideationtocreating the perfect thumbnail. We can even help you build out awinning YouTube Shorts strategy.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#1 Do your Research
Research your topic before you start creating. Before you set up your lights, before you plug in your mic. Search for the topic you’re looking to create content around. Are people interested? What questions do people have that you can answer?What’s the content gap you’re going to fill?
This information will determine your SEO strategy.
#2 Pick your Keywords
What information are your potential viewers looking for? What are they typing into the search bar? A littlekeyword researchwill help you craft your topic.
Use the TubeBuddyKeyword Explorer toolon YouTube to see keyword suggestions pop up based on what people are looking for.
#3 Think long-tail
Get specific. Think about what your ideal viewer is really looking for. Instead of “San Diego Zoo” target something like “what to do at San Diego zoo.” Instead of “makeup,” think “smokey eye makeup how to.” Look for the sweet spot of high traffic and low competition. Avoid broad, single word key phrases.
#4 Check the Overall Score
Look at the Overall Score inTubeBuddy Keyword Explorerto see how well a certain keyword will perform. The Weighted Score takes into consideration your channel’s size and average views per video. The Unweighted Score doesn’t account for that information and is more generalized. Look at the Weighted Score for the most accurate prediction for your channel specifically.
#5 Green Means Go
Keyword Explorer makes YouTube video SEO as easy as it can be. Experiment with different keywords and key phrases. Use theWeightedscore specifically. It balances how many people are searching for a given keyword and how heavy the competition is. This is the best indicator for how your key phrases will perform. Move the gauge into the green and you’re good to go.
#6 Be Consistent
Keep targeting the same keywords and key phrases. The more you cover one topic, the more authority YouTube, Google, and other search engines assume you have. Save keywords and key phrases to your Tag List in TubeBuddy Keyword Explorer.
#7 Save That for Later
You won’t always be ready to roll on a new video idea when it hits you. If the keyword data says it’s a good topic, save it to your TubeBuddyVideo Topic Planner. Next time you’re trying to figure out what video you should create, you have an idea at the ready.
#8 Prioritize Title, Description, Tags
YouTube prioritizes three main pieces of metadata when understanding and recommending a video in search. First is your video’stitle. Next, it’s the videodescription. Third is thetags. Spend YouTube search optimization efforts accordingly.
#9 Go for an Exact Match
Incorporate that exact search phrase you’re targeting in your title.TubeBuddy Title Generatormakes this easy. Include the same words in the same order. For example, if we’re targeting “San Diego Zoo Bus Tour,” “My Bus Tour of the San Diego Zoo” isn’t the best title. Simply rephrasing to “My San Diego Zoo Bus Tour” will net better results.
Using the exact term will ensure YouTube connects our video with the phrase we want to target.
#10 From Left to Right
YouTube reads titles like Westerners read English. Left to right, in order of importance. So get your exact match key phrase in there ASAP. Don’t stuff it in at the end.
Use theTubeBuddy AI Title Generatorand let our AI help you create the perfect title to show up in search and get viewers to click.
#11 Split The Title
When optimizing your YouTube videos for search and for human readers, splitting the title into two parts can help.
Get your keyphrase in there first, then add context and entice the viewer to click through and let them know what your video is all about.
For example: “San Diego Zoo Bus Tour – What you need to know.”
#12 Use Dividers
You can separate your title to help make it easier to read using a few different types of dividers.
Common YouTube Title Dividers
YouTube reads right through a divider when looking at a title. So a title like “San Diego Zoo | Bus Tour Information” hits our “San Diego Zoo Bus Tour” keyphrase perfectly. You can use just about any divider you like but be consistent. That’s not a YouTube SEO tip but rather a style point.
#13 Key Info Up Top
YouTube focuses on the first 200 characters of your description… and so you should too. Get your exact keyphrase in there early. Get as much SEO info up top. However…
#14 Don’t Keyword Stuff
We’ve all seen titles and descriptions with keywords stuffed in. It’s obvious and as a viewer (or a shopper, looking at you Amazon resellers) it’s a turn-off. YouTube search knows this too and will penalize videos that stuff in keywords.
Rephrase your title and keyword phrase naturally into the first 200 characters of your description. For example: “Join us as we take the San Diego Zoo Bus Tour and fill you in on what you need to know!”
#15 No Links Up Front
Don’t include links in the first 200 characters. Place your links “below the fold,” which is a fun,old-timey wayof saying “lower on the page.”Putting links in the important first 200 characters is giving search too much weight to those links and confusing search engines, including YouTube search.
#16 Choose Your Tags Carefully
You can reuse tags on YouTube, but you need to make sure you’re including new tags for each new topic too. Rephrase what your title is trying to get across in different ways in the tags while staying as close to the original keyphrase as possible.
#17 Go Crazy With (Relevant) Tags
YouTube allows up to 500 characters in tags. Use them! Get as many relevant tags as possible in the tag field. Only use tags that are relevant to your video and your channel though. Irrelevant or off-topic tags will do more harm than good.
UseTubeBuddy’s suggested tagsto get help in finding additional tags to use for your video. They will automatically update based on what you currently have in your title and tags list.
#18 Don’t Ignore Your Channel Page
Optimizing videos for YouTube search is important. Don’t sleep on your Channel Page though. Spending a little time on your channel page canhelp your channel explode.
SEO can be challenging, but using tools like TubeBuddy can give you ways to find more accurate keywords, and can help you in YouTube search and be discovered!

#9 Go for an Exact Match
Incorporate that exact search phrase you’re targeting in your title.TubeBuddy Title Generatormakes this easy. Include the same words in the same order. For example, if we’re targeting “San Diego Zoo Bus Tour,” “My Bus Tour of the San Diego Zoo” isn’t the best title. Simply rephrasing to “My San Diego Zoo Bus Tour” will net better results.
Using the exact term will ensure YouTube connects our video with the phrase we want to target.
#10 From Left to Right
YouTube reads titles like Westerners read English. Left to right, in order of importance. So get your exact match key phrase in there ASAP. Don’t stuff it in at the end.
Use theTubeBuddy AI Title Generatorand let our AI help you create the perfect title to show up in search and get viewers to click.
#11 Split The Title
When optimizing your YouTube videos for search and for human readers, splitting the title into two parts can help.
Get your keyphrase in there first, then add context and entice the viewer to click through and let them know what your video is all about.
For example: “San Diego Zoo Bus Tour – What you need to know.”
#12 Use Dividers
You can separate your title to help make it easier to read using a few different types of dividers.
Common YouTube Title Dividers
YouTube reads right through a divider when looking at a title. So a title like “San Diego Zoo | Bus Tour Information” hits our “San Diego Zoo Bus Tour” keyphrase perfectly. You can use just about any divider you like but be consistent. That’s not a YouTube SEO tip but rather a style point.
#13 Key Info Up Top
YouTube focuses on the first 200 characters of your description… and so you should too. Get your exact keyphrase in there early. Get as much SEO info up top. However…
#14 Don’t Keyword Stuff
We’ve all seen titles and descriptions with keywords stuffed in. It’s obvious and as a viewer (or a shopper, looking at you Amazon resellers) it’s a turn-off. YouTube search knows this too and will penalize videos that stuff in keywords.
Rephrase your title and keyword phrase naturally into the first 200 characters of your description. For example: “Join us as we take the San Diego Zoo Bus Tour and fill you in on what you need to know!”
#15 No Links Up Front
Don’t include links in the first 200 characters. Place your links “below the fold,” which is a fun,old-timey wayof saying “lower on the page.”Putting links in the important first 200 characters is giving search too much weight to those links and confusing search engines, including YouTube search.
#16 Choose Your Tags Carefully
You can reuse tags on YouTube, but you need to make sure you’re including new tags for each new topic too. Rephrase what your title is trying to get across in different ways in the tags while staying as close to the original keyphrase as possible.
#17 Go Crazy With (Relevant) Tags
YouTube allows up to 500 characters in tags. Use them! Get as many relevant tags as possible in the tag field. Only use tags that are relevant to your video and your channel though. Irrelevant or off-topic tags will do more harm than good.
UseTubeBuddy’s suggested tagsto get help in finding additional tags to use for your video. They will automatically update based on what you currently have in your title and tags list.
#18 Don’t Ignore Your Channel Page
Optimizing videos for YouTube search is important. Don’t sleep on your Channel Page though. Spending a little time on your channel page canhelp your channel explode.
SEO can be challenging, but using tools like TubeBuddy can give you ways to find more accurate keywords, and can help you in YouTube search and be discovered!

How to Stand Out as a Gaming Creator on YouTube
As a niche, gaming is pretty saturated. Gaming has even spilled beyond the confines ofYouTubeto have its own platform inTwitch.
If you want to make an impact as a gaming content creator, this is a challenge.TubeBuddy helps gaming content creatorsstand out, but there’s not a lot of room for gaming generalists at this point. It pays to pick a sub-niche. The sheer number of gaming content creators is a challenge, but it’s also an opportunity; there are a lot of lessons to be learned from other creators.
With that in mind, below are the top things we see gaming creators doing right, and doing wrong, as they try to make a name for themselves in this competitive content niche. We’ve also included some ideas and lessons that every YouTube creator — not just those battling it out in gaming — can use.
Use the comments to let us know what you think we got right, what we got wrong, and your own thoughts and tactics. When creators work together, we all achieve better outcomes.
You Have a Dream
You pick up your favorite title, plug in, and start streaming. The fans come rolling in. soon, you’ve amassed a following; millions and millions of views. Lucrative brand deals soon follow. You’re making money with superchats. You’re selling out of merch. Every time you stream, people pay attention. Life is good.
Except that’s not how it works. More likely, you seem to have hit a wall at 125 subscribers. Your content is not that different from any of the hundreds of other people streaming the same game on YouTube or Twitch.
So how do you stand out? What can you do to set yourself apart and make yourself known? Even in today’s saturated gaming content market, there are things that you can do in order to get ahead.
Gaming is fun. Gaming content is fun. Making gaming content requires work. A lot of work. Possibly more work than any other content niche, just given the numbers.
Understand the Algorithm
MrBeast’s advice is tocreate for an audience, not an algorithm is good advice. Still, it pays to understand the YouTube algorithm, which is not as hard or complex as some would have us believe.
The biggest problem creators face is that they want to be successful but they don’t take the lessons the algorithm has to teach them.
This can mean cutting parts of a video that perform poorly, or avoiding curse words, for example. Thougha little swearingis apparently OK. And no, we’re not entirely sure how much swearing is “a little” swearing.
The fact remains, if you want your content to be found, you need to take a serious look at the analytics and make data-driven decisions.TubeBuddy can help there.
The lessons YouTube analytics has to offer might mean changing the way you edit your videos. It definitely means considering SEO in your video descriptions andoptimizing your channel page.
Pick a Game
Pick one game and go deep. Not only will it help you connect with an engaged niche audience and reduce your competition, it’s also so much easier for YouTube to understand channels that focus on one main topic.
If a user is looking forStranded Deepvideos, and you make exclusively Stranded Deep videos, YouTube wants to connect you two. If you make random videos about games, and one of your videos happens to be about Stranded Deep, the chances of your video being the top recommendation are necessarily lower.
Give YouTube and viewers a single, tight topic to focus on. So when someone searches for Stranded Deep videos, YouTube is like ‘hey, I know a channel that has tons of Stranded Deep content!’
Consider theOtherGame
The hot new GotY is here. In our hands. We can FINALLY start playing it and making videos and growing our channels!!! Right?!
Nope.
Don’t get me wrong here. We believe in moonshots and swinging for the fences… but we do have a reality to contend with.
Hundreds of creators have the same idea. The market is saturated. Don’t let that get you down. Look at the opportunity: with everyone talking about the same thing, maybe it’s a chance to stand out. Viewers are probably looking for something new and different. Now is a great time to go out and make it. Find an underserved niche. Use theTubeBuddy keyword research toolto uncover games that people are searching for with little competition. Make the kind of content you want to see.
Be An Authority
This is tough! You need to be the best at the game, or the best at talking about the game. You need to be an authority, maybe even an oracle.
Do playthroughs, for sure, but be the person people think of when they want insight or to share a theory about the game.
Farketis a great example of this idea in action. He started making videos aboutThe Forest, and while he did videos on other games as well, he found an early, cult audience and pivoted to make The Forest his channel’s main focus.
He did several playthroughs, but what really set him apart was the detailed and thorough videos he made about how the game works. He becametheauthority on The Forest, on YouTube and elsewhere.
He made videos about the map, how to find all the weapons, which weapons were statistically better, which weapons were better versus enemies, which weapons were better versus buildings, what was the fastest route to find all the weapons. Every week was a new, data-driven tutorial on things he had discovered. He took over the wiki page and created Reddit and Discord pages for the game. He went all-in.
This level of energy and passion can be tough to find. And frankly, it can take the fun out of the game. But as we said, being a successful gamer on YouTube takes a lot of work. It’s not all fun and games. Even when fun and games are your subject matter.
Keep it Healthy… And Keep ‘em Entertained
So not only do you need to put in the work to get viewers,  you need to keep those viewers entertained. You need to keep it fun. You need charisma. Even when you have been streaming for six hours, you’re tired and you can think of 100 things you’d rather be doing. You’ve got to smile, and you’ve got to engage.
Don’t sacrifice your mental health, it should go without saying. But recognize that there will be good days and bad days. You need to balance it all.
Being entertaining means getting creative. People respond to faces.It’s biology. So channels that feature the gamer’s face while they play fare better. Seeing the streamer adds another layer of interest to the game because it gives a narrative.
Practice talking to the camera like it’s your best friend. Practice explaining what is happening in the game. As mentioned above you should be editing your videos to get a leg up on your competition, so you can edit out the dead space and the ‘ums’ and ‘uhs’ and other filler words. Yeah… that’s more work. But it’s all part of the gaming content… game.
Edit Your Videos
We’ve said this a few times already but it deserves to be a tip on its own.
People are so accustomed to seeing a game being played that it behooves you to do something to set yourself apart. Next-level editing is a great way of doing that. Cut out the boring parts of the game. Add overlays. Create your own game related graphics, maps, HUD, use your own music… anything you can do to customize the experience is going to add a lot of viewer appeal. Add cutscenes, memes etc. There are so many options that are available in the editing bay.
Say Goodbye to TV and Hello to Nick Nimmin!
This is kind of a universal thing that anyone grinding for YouTube needs to hear. When I started I was serious about making a successful YouTube channel. Very serious. I gave up television, gaming and the radio for two full years (and then some).
All that time was spent learning what it takes to be successful on YouTube. Instead of watching TV I watchedNick Nimminvideos. Instead of listening to the radio during my 45 minute work commute every day I put on aRoberto Blakeplaylist. My time spent gaming was replaced withDee NimminandDaniel Batalvideos.
As a gaming creator, you’re going to have to sacrifice some time with the games you love for the cause.
Get Creative
Getting creative is the difference between a good channel and a great channel. Maybe it means supplementing your videos with the occasional niche-related prank or recording your dad’s reactions to the game as you play.
Maybe it means setting up your system so that you play the game at the beach every day or find a deli that is willing to let you stream from one of their booths as a means of free advertising.
The more out there you can get the more eye-catching and attention grabbing you can be the more likely you are to be seen (just don’t be afckjoshy). Get together with your friends and have a brainstorm session, see what fun things you can come up with.
Go Create Stuff
We live in interesting times. Technology continues to evolve and open up new horizons. These advancements bring us amazing games; works of art that stand historically alongside greats like Michaelangelo and Van Eyck. They also give us unparalleled access to people in a way we’ve never known, and this can make for stiff competition when you are trying to stand out.
Make your content great, put in the work and make data-driven decisions. It can be crowded… but crowded isn’t impossible.
After all, as Wayne Gretzky said (or as Michael Scott said Wayne Gretzky said): “you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”
So take your shot!

Getting Started on YouTube: Some Lessons Learned the Hard Way
Being a YouTube creator isn’t easy, but nor is working on an oil rig… and I know which one I prefer.
In 2016 I was a freshly promoted operations manager for a multi-million dollar drilling and wellhead company in the oil-rich Eagleford Shale of South Texas. In my work, I had suffered broken fingers, two blown discs in my back, a hernia, and a concussion. I was working 138 hour weeks and was disillusioned, seeing money getting thrown at safety problems and an unspoken “don’t ask, don’t tell” attitude to worker injuries.
On Easter I sat down with my dad and brother who were also working in the oilfield. We had a fun chat about what we would do if we ever got away from these jobs. I wanted to fish… but I knew I didn’t want to run charters or a commercial vessel. I love being out on the water with family. I didn’t want to spoil that by turning my hobby into work.
That’s how my journey as a creator began. In 2016, I launched theStanley Orchard YouTube channel.
I decided I would go all-in on sharing my family fishing experiences with the world in the hopes that it would one day take me away from the oilfield, give me some purpose, and a livelihood that brought me joy.
Everyone’s creator journey is different, and everyone is motivated by different things. However, there are some fundamental truths about becoming a content creator… and the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Pick Something That You Want to Excel At
You don’t need to be the absolute best at the thing you want to start a channel about… but by the end of your journey youwillbe a master of that thing. Be prepared for the journey and be ready to spend a lot of time mastering this craft.
If you are just learning, remember that these first videos on your channel are part of that learning process and they are also your channel’s backstory. There is value in being able to go back and see where you came from.
There is no better example of this than by going to see theearly videosthat MrBeast was putting out versus the ones he’s makingtoday.
In for the Long Haul
Creating content is a lot of work. Your first video will not be a viral hit. You probably won’t hit your stride until you’ve made over 100 videos. I’m not saying this to discourage you, but creators need to go in with their eyes open. You will need to be prolific. Even more so if you’re focusing on YouTube Shorts. Pick a subject for your channel you can see maintaining your interest and passion through 100 videos, 1,000 videos, and beyond.
What Do YouReallyWant?
It’d be nice if we could make a million dollars a year by just recording stuff with our phones, but that’s not how it works.
The motivation that starts most YouTube creators boils down to three basic things: fame, fortune, or passion. Only one of those things is in our control as creators.
Whether you’re pursuing your YouTube creator dream as a hobby, or because you genuinely want to help people with your content, or because you feel you have something unique to share, that’s great. Choose your content niche based on what you’re passionate about. Don’t do what everyone else is already doing. For starters, forget about subscriber count. Getting subs is great but subscriber count won’t actually give you any lasting satisfaction.
Ultimately, the goal of your YouTube efforts is probably to make money. Understanding theeconomics of YouTubeand how tomake money as a content creatorare important. Making great content in a niche where you have something unique to offer is the surest path to getting paid as a creator.
It’s fine to dream about making big bucks, or growing a massive subscriber base… but it’s better to focus on things that you, as a creator, can control.
Understanding CPM
CPM (cost per mille, or thousand)is what you’ll get paid for every 1,000 ad views. Not to be confused with video views. In order to get paid via Adsense on YouTube, a viewer must watch an ad before, during, or after your video.
Advertisers bid on the audiences they want to target based on the demographics/viewing habits that YouTube has identified. You get paid a portion of that money if the ad gets put on your video.
Think about the demographics of your content niche. The CPM for YouTube ads can vary from pennies to dollars, to hundreds of dollars in some cases.
Make It A Business
Getting paid in theYouTube Partner Program(YPP) is not the only way to make money with your content.
When starting a YouTube channel, it’s easy to get tunnel vision and only focus on said channel. What you really want is a business. Even as a small creator, you have options formaking money with content.
Offering your own product or service is another option and can help you focus your content too.
Talk to Your Family and Friends
As much as you want to believe that you are doing this on your own you are not. You are going to need support from your friends and family.
Building your YouTube channel is going to take time away from other things. If you can include friends and family in your journey, it might even bring you close together. At the very least, their opinions and insights into your content may be valuable.
Don’t discount the value of a supportive voice and a shoulder to cry on when things get tough… because things do get tough. Likewise, don’t underestimate the importance of sharing and celebrating your victories with another person who wishes you nothing but success.
Just Do It
You need an idea, you need a plan, and you need support. Beyond that, you just need to do it.
Don’t wait. Go film your first video. Go film 10 Shorts videos and script a bunch of videos and maybe even livestream your decisions. Whatever, it doesn’t matter.
The best ideas in the world amount to nothing if you don’t pull the trigger. What’s more, there is going to be a lot to learn on this journey and the only way you are going to learn it is by trial and error. Learn by doing. Go make your first 100 videos. You’ll learn a lot along the way. Every video you upload and every effort you make on your channel gets you closer to the polished, rewarding, and sustainable channel you envision. The secret to being a great creator, after all, is to create, createcreate!

TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer: The YouTuber’s Guide
As a YouTube creator, you want to give your potential viewers (and YouTube itself) every possible chance to find your video content. Until you build enough of a subscriber base to help build viewing momentum, you have to find the right keywords and phrases that best describe your videos. Only that way will you help YouTube determine whether it can serve up a video of yours when a viewer searches for content using specific words and phrases.
Luckily, TubeBuddy’sKeyword Exploreris an extremely powerful tool that creators can use to determine the best keywords to use so viewers and search engines can find their content.
If you’re aPro, Legend, or Enterprise license holder, you have full access to this feature. But don’t worry, you even get a free trial if you’re on our free license. You’ll soon be able to uncover short and long-tail search terms, which will improve your video’s search rankings and increase your views.
You can also discover trending keyword tags tokeep your videos relevant long after they are published.With this feature, you can gain valuable insights into what people search for on YouTube and optimize your content to meet their needs.
How TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer Can Help You Find Success on YouTube
Not only is ourKeyword Explorerthe #1 YouTube Keyword Explorer in the world but it’s also used by some of the most successful creators and brands. They use it to quickly and easily identify keywords attracting the most searches and include them in their content to ensure their videos are at the top of the results.
What makes Keyword Explorer so valuable to YouTubers is that it provides detailed information on the volume and competition level of keywords.
You can clearly see how many searches per month are generated on a specific keyword or keyphrase, which in turn will indicate how difficult they are to rank for (especially for a beginner channel.) This invaluable information can then help you identify keywords that you are less competitive and that you do have a chance to rank for.
We can also provide keyword suggestions related to your main ones so that you can expand and build on your keyword strategy to reach an even wider audience.
On top of this, Keyword Explorer provides a range of options to help optimize your videos. For maximum reach and engagement. You can create or update your titles and descriptions based on your keyword research, as well as analyze your competitor’s keyword strategy.
Where to Find Keyword Explorer on TubeBuddy
Make sure you’re signed in to your TubeBuddy account on YouTube to access the tool. Then just open the dashboard and click on ‘Launch Keyword Explorer Now’ or Select Keyword Explorer from the TubeBuddy drop-down dashboard located in the top right corner.
You’ll also find it in the Video details screen, on the Tag list on a video watch page, and while you are uploading a new video.
How to Find the Best Keywords with Keyword Explorer
Keyword Explorer helps you understand the kinds of relevant words and phrases that viewers on YouTube actually search for. It will also help you brainstorm possible content ideas. Let’s see this in action.
Let’s say you’re a new or small baking channel that specializes in cake baking. You have an award-winning recipe for chocolate cake, and you want to share it with the world. That’s a fantastic goal to have, but with respect, there’s absolutely no way you’re going to rank for that term off the bat: this video explains why:
So, you’re not going to rank for ‘chocolate cake recipe’ as a new creator because there are. hundreds of thousands of creators are trying to rank for the same term. The tool will return ‘Poor’ as a Weighted score (more on that later) which gives you a huge signal that you’re wasting your time with this term.
However, if you niche down and create a ‘vegan, low-carb chocolate birthday cake’ video, you boost your chances of search visibility. The score is now ‘Good.’ However, tweak that title even more to ‘sugar-free chocolate birthday cake’ and boom!
Keyword Explorer has flagged this particular title as an excellent choice in terms of opportunity. Of course, to be successful, you’ll need to publish a video around that topic, but you can see the opportunities available to you to create content around a particular topic.
Weighted vs. Unweighted Keyword Scores
There’s a lot more to the data behind our keyword scores, so let’s dive into it.
‘Unweighted Score’The unweighted score is just ageneralscore. While it is somewhat beneficial, it’s very broad and not calculated for your own YouTube channel. Using the unweighted score may throw you off course because it doesn’t take into account your past content, metadata, views, and engagements.
‘Weighted Score’The Weighted score is invaluable in gaining a unique insight into what should work for you as a creator on your channel specifically. You can use this metric to get a good sense of whether or not you have a good chance of ranking for a particular keyword based on your past content.
‘Optimization Strength’for our chosen keyphrase is also excellent. This metric reflects how many of the highest performing videos include ‘sugar-free chocolate birthday cake’ in that order in their titles.Learn more in this video.
In other words, it corresponds to how well-optimized the search results are. Do the top-ranking videos use the keyword in their titles? In their descriptions & tags? Are there exact matches or just partial matches?
Note:if there is sufficient data available, you’ll also see a video ranking in the top 20 on YouTube for this very keyword target that generates around 1K views at the bottom of the dashboard that will give you an idea of the minimum amount of traffic you have to generate to rank in the top 20.
The next step is to click on the‘Results’tab. From here, you can see the top 20 videos that are well-optimized for this target because those keywords, when they’re in the exact order, will be highlighted in bright yellow.
When only a portion of that keyword target is in the titles of the top-ranking videos, it’ll show up highlighted but in a much lighter yellow color. Think of these videos as semantically similar, meaning they’re using some of the same keywords in their title but not the exact words in the exact order.
‘Competition’ is another relative score based on several factors. We look at how many results there are for a specific keyword or phrase and how many views the video results have. Also, how many times your search term appears in the title, tags, and description of each video in the results. These things help predict how hard it would be for you to rank high in the search results. Learn more about Keyword Explorer’s Research Score analysis in the video:
As a YouTuber, a vital key to success is identifying relevant keywords and phrases that best describe our video content. That way, you’re giving YouTube the information it needs to return a video of yours when a viewer searches for content using specific words and phrases that you’ve optimized for.

TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer: The YouTuber’s Guide
As a YouTube creator, you want to give your potential viewers (and YouTube itself) every possible chance to find your video content. Until you build enough of a subscriber base to help build viewing momentum, you have to find the right keywords and phrases that best describe your videos. Only that way will you help YouTube determine whether it can serve up a video of yours when a viewer searches for content using specific words and phrases.
Luckily, TubeBuddy’sKeyword Exploreris an extremely powerful tool that creators can use to determine the best keywords to use so viewers and search engines can find their content.
If you’re aPro, Legend, or Enterprise license holder, you have full access to this feature. But don’t worry, you even get a free trial if you’re on our free license. You’ll soon be able to uncover short and long-tail search terms, which will improve your video’s search rankings and increase your views.
You can also discover trending keyword tags tokeep your videos relevant long after they are published.With this feature, you can gain valuable insights into what people search for on YouTube and optimize your content to meet their needs.
How TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer Can Help You Find Success on YouTube
Not only is ourKeyword Explorerthe #1 YouTube Keyword Explorer in the world but it’s also used by some of the most successful creators and brands. They use it to quickly and easily identify keywords attracting the most searches and include them in their content to ensure their videos are at the top of the results.
What makes Keyword Explorer so valuable to YouTubers is that it provides detailed information on the volume and competition level of keywords.
You can clearly see how many searches per month are generated on a specific keyword or keyphrase, which in turn will indicate how difficult they are to rank for (especially for a beginner channel.) This invaluable information can then help you identify keywords that you are less competitive and that you do have a chance to rank for.
We can also provide keyword suggestions related to your main ones so that you can expand and build on your keyword strategy to reach an even wider audience.
On top of this, Keyword Explorer provides a range of options to help optimize your videos. For maximum reach and engagement. You can create or update your titles and descriptions based on your keyword research, as well as analyze your competitor’s keyword strategy.

A Quick Guide to Watch Time – YouTube’s Top Ranking Factor
As a YouTube creator, the challenge is to stand out. The way to stand out is to understand YouTube and viewer behavior; to research, create, optimize, and promote your videos in a way that viewers love and that YouTube understands.
Key factors YouTube’s algorithms consider include:
However, there’sone overriding metric that YouTube takes into accountwhen it comes to ranking and promoting your content:watch time.
Watch time is the biggest single factor used to rank videos in search results, recommendations, and in trending section. The more watch time a video receives, the higher it will rank on YouTube, resulting in more views, engagement, and subscribers.
Watch Time – YouTube’s Top Ranking Factor
Watch time represents the total amount of time viewers spend watching your video on YouTube. The platform has confirmed that watch time is an integral part of its search and discovery algorithm.
This metric is the best measure of how engaged a viewer is with a video. It’s simple: the longer they watch, the more interested they are, which means the video is delivering value.
Higher video watch times indicate to YouTube’s algorithm that your channel is worthy of promotion in the feed and suggestions area. For creators, this may result in revenue-generating options like brand sponsorships and partnerships. The typical audience retention rate is between 50% and 60%; therefore, the more time a viewer spends watching your video, the better it is for your YouTube channel.
For creators, watch time — both total minutes watched and as a percentage relative to total video lengh — is the most essential metric to grow their channel and reach a wider audience.
How to Find Your Watch Time Data in YouTube Studio
Below the main chart, you’ll find a list of the top videos driving the most watch time for your channel:
Watch Time and YouTube Monetization
If you’re a YouTube creator who wants to monetize your content through Adsense revenue,, you’ll need to have generated 1,000 subscribers and4,000 hours of watch time on your channel over the last 365 days. Watch our video on how to reach this milestone as quickly as you can:
With the help of quality, engaging video content, publishing consistency, optimized thumbnail, titles, and descriptions, as well as other best practice, all YouTube creators can easily increase their YouTube watch time today.

How to Easily Edit YouTube Info Cards (Even if You Have Thousands)
Info cards (AKA YouTube cards) play a vital role in audience retention, video content strategy, and channel growth. This handy feature allows you to guide viewers to other types of content, both on and off YouTube, and can really boost the ROI of your video.
They are a valuable asset that every creator should consider as part of their creation and publishing workflow. Let’s take a deeper dive into what they are.
What Are YouTube Info Cards?
Info cards are interactive panels that pop up in the upper right corner of the video frame. They let creators share clickable links to relevant content anywhere in a video.
How do you know an info card is about to appear? A little white circle with an “i” in the middle  pops up in the top right-hand corner of the video like this:
When a viewer clicks on the icon, it expands to display the content of the card, which can include suggested playlists, links to other videos, and more.
By strategically placing these cards at specific timestamps or relevant points in their videos, creators can enhance viewer engagement. For instance, info cards can be used to link to previous or related videos, encouraging viewers to explore the creator’s content further. Creators can extend their reach and establish a robust online presence beyond the YouTube platform.
You can see an info card in action on TubeBuddy’s “YouTube Partner Program Changes, New Features, and More!: video. At the 3:01 minute mark, which suggests further content the viewer might be interested in.
21 Reasons Why YouTube Creators Should Use Info Cards
How to Add Info Cards to YouTube Videos
The process ofadding a cardcouldn’t be easier, just follow these instructions:
If you’re a TubeBuddyLegend or Enterprise license holder, you have access to a number of info card tools, includingCard Templates,Bulk Copy Cards, andBulk Delete Cards. For more information, watch our explainer video:
How to Bulk Edit YouTube Info Cards with TubeBuddy
Cards are a fantastic promotional tool for YouTubers. But manually adding cards one by one on all of your videos is a tedious and time-consuming process. TubeBuddy’sBulk Copy Cardsfeature makes it so easy!
Each video is processed one at a time and takes just a second or two. 2,000 videos might take about 60 minutes to complete the process. That’s an enormous time-saver for any YouTube creator.
TubeBuddy handles all card types, and each time YouTube rolls out a new type of card, it is added to our system within a day or two. Get all the information you need here:
If you’re a creator aiming to take your content to new heights, remember to leverage the power of info cards and unleash their potential to captivate and grow your audience.

How to Easily Edit YouTube Info Cards (Even if You Have Thousands)
Info cards (AKA YouTube cards) play a vital role in audience retention, video content strategy, and channel growth. This handy feature allows you to guide viewers to other types of content, both on and off YouTube, and can really boost the ROI of your video.
They are a valuable asset that every creator should consider as part of their creation and publishing workflow. Let’s take a deeper dive into what they are.
What Are YouTube Info Cards?
Info cards are interactive panels that pop up in the upper right corner of the video frame. They let creators share clickable links to relevant content anywhere in a video.
How do you know an info card is about to appear? A little white circle with an “i” in the middle  pops up in the top right-hand corner of the video like this:
When a viewer clicks on the icon, it expands to display the content of the card, which can include suggested playlists, links to other videos, and more.
By strategically placing these cards at specific timestamps or relevant points in their videos, creators can enhance viewer engagement. For instance, info cards can be used to link to previous or related videos, encouraging viewers to explore the creator’s content further. Creators can extend their reach and establish a robust online presence beyond the YouTube platform.
You can see an info card in action on TubeBuddy’s “YouTube Partner Program Changes, New Features, and More!: video. At the 3:01 minute mark, which suggests further content the viewer might be interested in.
21 Reasons Why YouTube Creators Should Use Info Cards
How to Add Info Cards to YouTube Videos
The process ofadding a cardcouldn’t be easier, just follow these instructions:
If you’re a TubeBuddyLegend or Enterprise license holder, you have access to a number of info card tools, includingCard Templates,Bulk Copy Cards, andBulk Delete Cards. For more information, watch our explainer video:
How to Bulk Edit YouTube Info Cards with TubeBuddy
Cards are a fantastic promotional tool for YouTubers. But manually adding cards one by one on all of your videos is a tedious and time-consuming process. TubeBuddy’sBulk Copy Cardsfeature makes it so easy!
Each video is processed one at a time and takes just a second or two. 2,000 videos might take about 60 minutes to complete the process. That’s an enormous time-saver for any YouTube creator.
TubeBuddy handles all card types, and each time YouTube rolls out a new type of card, it is added to our system within a day or two. Get all the information you need here:
If you’re a creator aiming to take your content to new heights, remember to leverage the power of info cards and unleash their potential to captivate and grow your audience.

How to Optimize Your Thumbnail and Title Click-Through Rates
YouTube might be showing your stuff, but are people clicking?
The percentage of viewers who click (or tap) to watch your video after YouTube shows the thumbnail and/or title on the homepage, in suggested videos, or in search results.
Click-through rate (CTR) is an essential metric to understand and measure for any creator. The higher the CTR, the better. Not just because it directly translates to people watching your stuff but because the better your CTR, the more likely YouTube is to recommend your video.
CTR is a simple calculation: divide the number ofclickson your video by the number ofimpressions, then multiply by 100. A video with 1,000 impressions and 100 clicks has a CTR of 10%.
Ways to improve your YouTube CTR include:
#1 Optimize your thumbnail:Your thumbnail is the first thing people see. Make your thumbnails high-quality, relevant, and visually appealing. A solid text hook in bold text helps. Don’t use misleading or clickbait thumbnails.
#2 Optimize your video title:An attention-grabbing title is key. Use concise language to accurately describe the video and to spark interest. For example, “The Perfect Fluffy Pancake Recipe.” is better than “How to Make Pancakes.”
#3 Optimize your description:Your description should tell viewers what your video is about, engage their interest, and build anticipation for the content. Use relevant keywords to help your video rank in search results.
Next, include any important details or instructions. Use bullet points to break up the text, and add any links to relevant resources or products you mention in the video.
#4 Use relevant tags:Tags helpYouTube’s algorithmunderstand what your video is about, which helps it appear in search results. Use relevant tags that relate to your video’s content.
#5 Engage your audience:When viewers leave comments on your video, respond promptly and thoughtfully. Engaging with your audience builds a loyal following and encourages viewers to click on your future videos.
Consider creating videos that directly address your audience’s questions or concerns. This type of content is highly engaging and can improve your CTR and overall channel growth.
#6 Analyze your data:Dig into the data for valuable insights into your video’s performance and audience engagement. Identify which videos have a high CTR and which need improvement. Adjust accordingly.
A data-driven approach helps creators make content that resonates with the audience and improves channel performance.
While YouTube analytics can get you some of the data, TubeBuddy analytics tools help you interpret and act on it.
A/B Testing YouTube Titles, Descriptions, and Custom Thumbnails
ATubeBuddy A/B test lets creators try two or more variations of a variable (the thumbnail, description, title, etc.). These variations are shown to different segments of YouTube viewers to determine which version performs best in terms ofCTR.
Some of the biggest creators (yes, that includes MrBeast) will chop and change titles and thumbnails if their video isn’t performing. With TubeBuddy A/B Testing tools, this option is available to any creator with aLegend license!! Learn more about how toA/B test your YouTube custom thumbnails, titles, and descriptionsin the following video:
If you want to gain an advantage as a YouTube creator, focus on increasing yourYouTube click-through rate (CTR).to boost your chances of success.

MrBeast’s Brilliant Advice for Small YouTube Channels
There are four incredible things that we learned fromMrBeastregarding new YouTube channels and one extra thing that completely shocked us.
You may be a smaller channel on YouTube, but we know you want to build a community. monetize your content, get more views, andwatch time.  The biggest YouTuber in this world started from zero, and he became the largest creator around today. Who better to give advice about what kickstarted his channel? Here’s the advice he shared that made him a YouTube superstar. Carry on for the tips or watch our video:
#1 Overcome Analysis Paralyze
A lot of creators get analysis paralysis, and they’ll just sit there and they’ll plan their first video for three months. For any of you reading, especially if you have zero videos on your channel, your first video is not going to get views.. Your first 10 are not going to get views. So stop sitting there and thinking for months and months on end, and just get to work and start uploading. All you need to do, this applies to people who have not uploaded videos but have dreams of being a YouTuber, is make 100 videos and improve something every time.
#2 Create and Publish 100 Videos
Imagine you made one YouTube video per week for an entire year. That would be 52 videos for a whole year. Now imagine if you did that for two years. That would be 104 videos. Just think about that. It would take you two years to put out one video a week to hit a minimum of 100 YouTube videos.
You just have to start and accept that, as a creator, this is when you’re going to know the least about the filming, editing, and optimization process. And that’s OK. Even the most successful creators had to start from the same position.
In fact, it’s an advantage to start when you are the least ready and the least prepared.MrBeastknows new creators spend a long time planning and strategizing the video when you need to just execute and make a video. Forget about what you’re going to do and just do it. Press record, hit upload, and publish the video.
#3 Fail on Purpose
Fail early and fail often. Let’s be real: when you’re brand new to making YouTube videos, you’re going to fail. You’re going to get videos that get no views. You’re going to get videos that have a low click-through rate. You’re going to have many failures along your way, like trying to film in public but getting interrupted or trying to get the right shot for your video and it just doesn’t work.
When you embrace failure, you essentially take the power out of failing. What I mean by this is, when you give power to failure, it has a hold on you. Essentially, when you fail on purpose, you are inviting failure into your life, and you are making it okay and not such a scary thing. That way, when those failures do happen, everything else doesn’t seem as bad.
#4 Ignore the Noise
Look at your social media feed. One quick scroll through the platforms will have thousands of pieces of content begging for your attention. That is all noise.
Have you ever gone to YouTube to search for a video that you want to make or for a specific creator that you have in mind, and you want to be able to replicate that style of video? Maybe you’ve watched one, two, or 10 videos, and at the end of it, you end up not making anything. You almost feel like you can’t because there are so many voices inside your head, including, “Do it this way” or, “Oh, make it look this way,” and you lose your own way. Yes, it’s important to use videos as creativity and inspiration but don’t let that control you and stop you from creating what it is that you want to create.
But that’s not the only thing that’s noise. The comment section on YouTube can be a tough place to navigate. You could have 1,000 positive comments, and you get that one negative comment, and it stands out to you, and you think about it for the entire day.
Maybe someone said something about your video or specifically about you, and you can’t help but question; “Should I be doing this? Is this right for me? Are they right?” It’s all noise. Anyone that is hating on you, anyone that is negative towards you, is noise.
#5 Become an Artist and Analyst
Filming, scripting, editing, and publishing videos are art. Looking at your click-through rate, your views, and your likes is data analysis.  Become both.
Become someone who falls in love with the process of making videos, and become someone who falls in love with understanding your analytics. Don’t forget the art and the craft that goes into making a video. But also, don’t forget you need to analyze the data, otherwise, you won’t know what you can improve on.
The most important thing, remember why you started.
Remember why you filmed the video. Remember why you edited that video, and remember why you uploaded and decided to publish that video. That’s the magic of everything. If you can become the person who falls in love with the process of making the best possible video ever and also the person who understands the analytic side of making the best possible video ever, that’s the beauty of both. possibly can, all those numbers you’re worried about, all the likes, the views, everything, all of that will take care of itself. Just remember why you started.

One Simple Trick For Getting MORE Views on YouTube!
Want to know the simplest way to dramatically increase views on your YouTube? It might seem unusual, but it’s insanely effective! We call itReverse Content Creation.
But first, let’s talk about why certain videos rack up views.
Impressions Click-Through Rate
The most significant factor determining how many views a video usually gets is the Impressions click-through rate. You’ll find those details in your Video Analytics data on YouTube Studio mobile and desktop.
In super simple terms, a 10% Impressions Click-Through Rate means that out of everyone who saw your video, 10% actually clicked and watched it.
So, let’s say YouTube showed your video 1,000 times on the platform, and 100 people clicked and watched it, then your ImpressionsClick-Through Rate (CTR) would be a respectable 10%.
The higher this number, the more views your videos will usually receive. You boost this number by crafting irresistible thumbnails and titles around topics your audience finds interesting.
We believe this is the most important metric for getting more views on YouTube.
You’ve probably heard about the importance of retention, average view duration, and smashing the like button. However, those metrics come into playaftersomeone clicks on your video.
People click on your video based on its thumbnail, title, and topic, and that’s measured by the click-through rate. See more in our explainer video:
Some of the most popular videos have just average retention rates. But, thanks to their high CTR, these videos still managed to rake in a ton of views.
Reverse Content Creation
Usually, content creators follow a familiar process: they come up with a topic, they create the content, and then design the thumbnail and title they hope will get people to watch. While this process may seem logical, sometimes we do it a little differently.
Reverse content creation is when you decide on the title and thumbnail before creating the actual video content. If you don’t believe the title and thumbnail will grab attention and earn a high click-through rate, you don’t even bother creating the video.
This will keep you from investing a lot of time into a video that won’t even get seen. We practice reverse content creation all the time.
If our video producers are not sure what to title a video, they think of one that a YouTube viewer would find irresistible like.“The Genius SHORTCUT To 4,000 Hours of Watch Time!”. Then they experiment with a thumbnail image that includes, for example, an upward graph.
Finding Inspiration From Other Creators
We saw a video from a creator named Dan Koe titled “How To Get Ahead Of 99% Of People (In 6-12 Months)”:
We loved the title and thumbnail and could tell by the views that others found it clickable, too, so they saved it for later.
Of course, it’s from a different niche than YouTube education, but they knew the subject was good motivational content and that many of our viewers would appreciate it. They looked at it and said, we need to make a video titled X; what should the video be about?
Instead of creating a title andthumbnailfor an existing video, you craft a video around a title and thumbnail you know is incredibly clickable. Now you’re producing content you know will get views rather than content you hope will get views.

This One YouTube SEO Hack Can Boost Your Rankings, Views, and Subscribers!
YouTube SEO is more than just basic titles, descriptions, and tags. In this post, we focus on one of the most underrated forms of SEO that’s hiding in plain sight. Is there a secret YouTube SEO trick that’s allowing YouTubers to generate millions of views and crack the YouTube algorithm? We tested the theory and are passing the information on to you.
First, let’s take a look at creator Matthew Beem. You may have seen himhiring real-life Spider-Manor buildingMrBeast Squid Games. Matthew does something with his YouTube content that allows him to show up in search results better than most other YouTubers, and we’ll discuss how. Take a look at Matthew’s latest YouTube video, “Overnight in the World’s Best Airport”:
There was something that stood out to us, not within his video itself, but within the description. Out of the 5,000 characters YouTube allows for a description, Matthew used 2032 of those characters. In the description, he has two separate blocks. One block is more of a recap/story about the video and everything that happened within it. The second block is where he leveraged more phrases and more keywords. Why would he do this?
We ran a test on some of the phrases that he was using in the description that related to the title. We copied and pasted a few of his keywords into the YouTube search bar on a private browser. We wanted to see if these keywords were actual phrases that people could be searching for and see if they were helping Matthew get more views.
The first term we searched for was,“I lived in a luxury airport for 24 hours.”His was the third video in the results. to pop up. The next term was “living in the world’s best airport.”again, he was the third result to appear. The final term we searched for was “we lived in the Singapore airport”; again, he popped up third.
However, viewers are also going to YouTube to search for content like “luxury airport” and “Singapore Airport.” These are all key phrases that Matthew uses to his advantage so his video will rank.
What does this all mean? For example, if you’re watching a similar video fromYes Theory,YouTube is more likely to recommendMatthew’s content to the viewer. This allows him to generate more views just by solely including the titles in his video.
How You Can Take Advantage of This YouTube SEO Hack

YouTube is using everything to index your video and to put it in front of the people that may be most interested in watching it.
If you’re looking to make a piece of content, research other content that is similar to yours, and see what’s out there on YouTube. If there are similar titles and tags within those videos, use those in the description of your content to be able to maximize the amount of reach that it can get.
Note: this doesn’t mean you keyword stuff your titles, tags, and descriptions with subjects that are not related to the actual video itself. Doing that opens you up to the risk of your video being taken down.Always make sure that you have the proper tags, titles, and the appropriate description that are related to the video.

How YouTube Promotes Your Content: Understanding the Algorithm and Watch Time
YouTube has the potential to get your content in front of millions of viewers, but with so much content competing for attention, it’s hard to get noticed.
As a creator, the challenge is to stand out. The way to stand out is to understand YouTube and viewer behavior; to research, create, optimize, and promote your videos in a way that viewers love and that YouTube understands.
Watch time is one of the most critical metrics that YouTube usesto determine the value and relevance of a video.
It is the primary factor that YouTube’s algorithm uses to rank videos in search results, recommendations, and the trending section. This means thatthe more watch time a video receives, the higher it will rank on YouTube, resulting in more views, engagement, and subscribers.
What is watch time, and why is it so crucial?
Because it represents the level of engagement, a viewer has with a video. The longer a viewer watches a video, the more they are interested in the content, which means the video delivers value to the viewer. This results in increased engagement, such as likes, comments, shares, and subscriptions, all factors that YouTube’s algorithm considers when ranking videos.
Improving watch timeis essential for creators who want to grow their channels and reach a wider audience.
Understanding How YouTube Works
So let’s start out by understanding how YouTube works from a content creator perspective.
YouTube is the world’s largest video-sharing platform. It boasts billions of active users and millions of hours of video content. YouTube’s famous (or infamous?) machine learning algorithms selectively surface content to viewers.
YouTube’s Recommendations algorithmhighlights content based on the viewer’s habits and interests. YouTube has a vested interest in keeping people watching and coming back. Analyzing data on content, user behavior, engagement patterns, etc.,  the algorithm makes recommendations personalized to the individual.
YouTube ingests over 80 billion bits of information about user behavior every day, and accordingly, its algorithms get smarter every day.
Key factorsYouTube’s algorithmsconsider include:
All of these points and more are factored into YouTube Recommendations: personalized content recommendations unique to each viewer. You can learn more about the algorithm in this video:
As YouTube viewers, we find content that matches our interests (thanks, YouTube!) As YouTube creators, we need to figure out how our content fits into the mix and how to use the recommendations algorithm to our advantage. Read on.
Watch Time – YouTube’s Top Ranking Factor
Watch time is the biggest single factor used to rank videos in search results, recommendations, and the trending section. The more watch time a video receives, the higher it will rank on YouTube, resulting in more views, engagement, and subscribers.
Watch time is the best measure of how engaged a viewer is with a video. It’s simple: the longer they watch, the more interested they are, which means the video is delivering value. There’s a correlated increase in likes, comments, shares, subscriptions, and other engagement metrics, which also factor into how YouTube ranks and recommends videos.
For creators, watch time — both total minutes watched and as a percentage relative to total video time — is the most essential metric to grow their channel and reach a wider audience. Focus on increasing watch time, and you’re onto a winning formula.

This YouTube Video Trick Will Make Your Channel EXPLODE!
Why do some videos go viral while others fall flat? What makes some content so popular while others fail to get a single view? The answer might surprise you.
Many YouTubers are using a very smart strategy to significantly grow their channels in a very unexpected way. Watch this video for more details:
Don’t Be Afraid of Using Clickbait Tactics
Let’s talk about clickbait, but not the kind that you’re thinking about. I believe that there are two categories of clickbait; dishonest, manipulative, and time-wasting, and useful, satisfying, and value-driven. This is the one we’re talking about.
Although clickbait has a bad reputation, it is not inherently negative or manipulative. By definition, it’s content whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage viewers to click. Every good marketer and YouTuber knows that nothing happens until somebody clicks. From thumbnails that portray unrealistic scenes to titles that intentionally leave out information to create curiosity, it’s all done to encourage viewers to click.
Some people say that using all caps in your titles is obnoxious, clickbaity, and desperate, but we tested it. All we did was change some words to all caps in this video’s title.
As a result, the click-through rate went up by 35%, and the views went up by 40%.
Same thumbnail, the same video, just a little bit more clickbaity. Have you noticed that Mr. Beast uses the same exact face in almost every thumbnail? Nobody makes that face in real life, but it gets people to click.
Small changes to how you present your videos can determine how many people you reach, how many views your video gets, and, ultimately, how much money you make.
So what’s the trick?
How do you get yourself noticed and give your videos the best chance to grow without annoying off your viewers and breaking their trust?
Present Your Video Content in the Most Compelling Way
A key factor contributing to the success or failure of a video is how you position it to people.The framing effectis a psychological phenomenon that describes how people respond to choices or concepts based on the way they are presented or framed to them.
How something is presented makes a difference in how it is perceived. Just like most people will buy a sanitizing product that says, “Kills 95% of germs” over one that says “5% of germs survive”. On YouTube, the framing effect is used to draw viewers in by presenting your video in a way that’s more likely to attract attention.
There are two main ways to do this.
Let’s look at an example.
Veritasium, a science-based channel, posted a video titled Strange Applications of the Magnus Effect. While the video was entertaining and educational, nobody was clicking on that title. It was framed poorly. The title only appealed to a very specific audience, mostly people searching for or with preexisting knowledge of the Magnus effect.
To his target audience, the video was unappealing. But then he reframed it, changed the title toBackspin Basketball Flies Off Dam, and changed the thumbnail. Suddenly, his boring video became interesting. Way less straightforward than before and definitely more clickbaity, but now it appealed to more people, and the video has over 50 million views. It’s the same video, just delivered differently. Veritasium got the masses interested in science just by changing the way that he framed it. Now let’s get really tactical on how you can reframe your videos so your videos can start seeing better results.
The Art of Reframing Your YouTube Content
The first step to reframing your video is to determine the purpose, outcome, or benefit that it offers. Whether it’s for learning or having fun, consider the most interesting reason or benefit why viewers would want to click on your video.
Viewers actually respond to benefits over tactics, just like Get Abs in 2 Weeks makes for a stronger title than Do Crunches for 15 minutes a day. One is framed as an unattractive tactic, while the other is framed as an attractive benefit. Both videos are absolutely identical; only one of them is going to get more clicks. So reframe your videos with all of that in mind.
Then meet the viewers where they are. As creators, we might be the experts in our niches. However, our viewers might only be beginners. You need to cater to their level of understanding and use language that they know. State your titles clearly so viewers can easily understand them without having to have prior knowledge or do a bunch of work to understand what your video is about.
Then pair your video with a well-framed thumbnail. Thumbnails play a crucial role in reframing, even with impressive titles. If the thumbnail fails to communicate the value and spark interest, it won’t be clicked.
Thumbnails are usually extreme exaggerations of the content, and they don’t always accurately depict reality. The goal here is the same as the title; to frame the video with its true value and to use visuals to capture the audience’s attention. If you pair a well-framed title with a well-framed thumbnail, you, my friend, have a banger.

This YouTube Video Trick Will Make Your Channel EXPLODE!
Why do some videos go viral while others fall flat? What makes some content so popular while others fail to get a single view? The answer might surprise you.
Many YouTubers are using a very smart strategy to significantly grow their channels in a very unexpected way. Watch this video for more details:
Don’t Be Afraid of Using Clickbait Tactics
Let’s talk about clickbait, but not the kind that you’re thinking about. I believe that there are two categories of clickbait; dishonest, manipulative, and time-wasting, and useful, satisfying, and value-driven. This is the one we’re talking about.
Although clickbait has a bad reputation, it is not inherently negative or manipulative. By definition, it’s content whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage viewers to click. Every good marketer and YouTuber knows that nothing happens until somebody clicks. From thumbnails that portray unrealistic scenes to titles that intentionally leave out information to create curiosity, it’s all done to encourage viewers to click.
Some people say that using all caps in your titles is obnoxious, clickbaity, and desperate, but we tested it. All we did was change some words to all caps in this video’s title.
As a result, the click-through rate went up by 35%, and the views went up by 40%.
Same thumbnail, the same video, just a little bit more clickbaity. Have you noticed that Mr. Beast uses the same exact face in almost every thumbnail? Nobody makes that face in real life, but it gets people to click.
Small changes to how you present your videos can determine how many people you reach, how many views your video gets, and, ultimately, how much money you make.
So what’s the trick?
How do you get yourself noticed and give your videos the best chance to grow without annoying off your viewers and breaking their trust?
Present Your Video Content in the Most Compelling Way
A key factor contributing to the success or failure of a video is how you position it to people.The framing effectis a psychological phenomenon that describes how people respond to choices or concepts based on the way they are presented or framed to them.
How something is presented makes a difference in how it is perceived. Just like most people will buy a sanitizing product that says, “Kills 95% of germs” over one that says “5% of germs survive”. On YouTube, the framing effect is used to draw viewers in by presenting your video in a way that’s more likely to attract attention.
There are two main ways to do this.
Let’s look at an example.
Veritasium, a science-based channel, posted a video titled Strange Applications of the Magnus Effect. While the video was entertaining and educational, nobody was clicking on that title. It was framed poorly. The title only appealed to a very specific audience, mostly people searching for or with preexisting knowledge of the Magnus effect.
To his target audience, the video was unappealing. But then he reframed it, changed the title toBackspin Basketball Flies Off Dam, and changed the thumbnail. Suddenly, his boring video became interesting. Way less straightforward than before and definitely more clickbaity, but now it appealed to more people, and the video has over 50 million views. It’s the same video, just delivered differently. Veritasium got the masses interested in science just by changing the way that he framed it. Now let’s get really tactical on how you can reframe your videos so your videos can start seeing better results.
The Art of Reframing Your YouTube Content
The first step to reframing your video is to determine the purpose, outcome, or benefit that it offers. Whether it’s for learning or having fun, consider the most interesting reason or benefit why viewers would want to click on your video.
Viewers actually respond to benefits over tactics, just like Get Abs in 2 Weeks makes for a stronger title than Do Crunches for 15 minutes a day. One is framed as an unattractive tactic, while the other is framed as an attractive benefit. Both videos are absolutely identical; only one of them is going to get more clicks. So reframe your videos with all of that in mind.
Then meet the viewers where they are. As creators, we might be the experts in our niches. However, our viewers might only be beginners. You need to cater to their level of understanding and use language that they know. State your titles clearly so viewers can easily understand them without having to have prior knowledge or do a bunch of work to understand what your video is about.
Then pair your video with a well-framed thumbnail. Thumbnails play a crucial role in reframing, even with impressive titles. If the thumbnail fails to communicate the value and spark interest, it won’t be clicked.
Thumbnails are usually extreme exaggerations of the content, and they don’t always accurately depict reality. The goal here is the same as the title; to frame the video with its true value and to use visuals to capture the audience’s attention. If you pair a well-framed title with a well-framed thumbnail, you, my friend, have a banger.

How to Create the Perfect YouTube Comment
Crafting the perfect YouTube comment is an exceptionally powerful way to gain a foothold on YouTube and other social media platforms.
Comments get handed around so readily that many are lost in a sea of endless emojis and low-value quips. A planned, well thought-out comment can provide insight into your authority on the subject, a curiosity into your own work, and offers a glimpse into the value that you can provide.
Here is an example of what I think about when writing a comment on someone else’s video or social media post and why it is important:
The Quantity of YouTube Comments Matter
No, you do NOT need to go out and spam every single video you watch, but you need to put some effort into your commenting. One comment per month is not going to do you much good. Like fishing, the more bait you can put in the water, the more chances you stand of catching a fish.
Timing is the Key!
Many viewers really do take the time to read YouTube comments, so remember you aren’t just speaking to the creator of the video but to the others who are going into the comments section.
Here’s my tip – pick the ten bigger creators in your niche and turn on the notifications for their channels. Be conscious of their upload schedule and make an attempt to comment on their videos as soon as they get published. Again, you want to provide good, knowledgeable information because; just posting ‘Hey, nice video’ provides absolutely no value to anybody. By being one of the first to comment, you put your words in front of every single person who comes to comment later.
Provide Real Value With Every Comment You Post
OK, you are committed to being the first to comment on videos for the top ten creators in your niche…now what do you write? I typically have a phrase in mind each morning that I tend to reuse for multiple comments (‘re-use,’ not copy and paste or spam). Something to the effect of referencing current events, or maybe I’ll stick to a keyword like ‘man, this is insightful’ or ‘my day is a little brighter because of your work.’ Something nice.
This will be just a small part of what you are writing; it helps to kickstart your comment but absolutely should not be the meat of what you are trying to say. For this, you need to watch their video and refer to something they did or said, preferably something that stands out. This will help to catch the attention of others who saw that same thing in the video and then came down to read the comments. If you fake it, you are going to get called out for it, or worse, you’ll be ignored. Also, it ALWAYS helps if you can provide some sort of insight, hot-take, or opinion on the events of the video. This is a great example of that which was left on this TubeBuddy video:
Respectfully Redirect
After commenting about something in the video and providing your own insight it is important to steer traffic in your direction. But BE RESPECTFUL. The last thing you want to do is say something like, ‘Hey, come check out my channel.’ That’s lame; it will likely get you thrown into the blocked comments category, and the second you say anything that is even remotely spammy for your channel, you are going to be ignored. I prefer to offer direction in the form of insight. For example, if someone posts a video about catching and cooking sheepshead I will say something like this:
“Oh, man, I LOVE me some sheepshead! One of my all-time favorite eating fish! We just caught about twenty of these guys for a recent video on our channel, and MAN, am I stoked to try this recipe you just showed me!”
BAM!!! Do you see what I did there?! I took their video and made it the focal point of the conversation. At the same time, everybody who reads that YouTube comment (including the person who made the video) sees that I run a fishing channel, and I catch sheepshead too. It isn’t pertinent to the comment at all, but it is a simple, subtle redirect that maybe the person who wrote this is worth checking out. Now to be fair, I only do this one in maybe ten comments on any given channel. It will get picked up on, so don’t overdo it.
Don’t forget, as a creator, you can also use your own comment section to redirect viewers to similar or helpful content:
Ideal YouTube Comment Length and Structure
Finally, there is one last thing to consider when writing the perfect YouTube comment. It always helps to write longer copy. YouTube educator Nick Nimmin has spoken many times about how it is important to answer the comments in your own videos because viewers crave that engagement. As a writer of comments, you can reverse engineer this.
When someone takes the time to write a long, thorough comment it shows that they are passionate about what they are talking about. Not every comment needs to be a novel, but it is a good practice to write long comments from time to time if the subject matter warrants it because these comments stand out and only further reflect the knowledge and value you can provide.
Writing valuable comments gives you access to people who view and appreciate what you do. It is an opportunity to reach out to people whom you otherwise would likely have little access to, and it is a chance for you to give a positive impression of your work before someone has a chance to see it firsthand. Done correctly and with the right mix of focus, insight, appreciation, and direction, a simple comment can very easily lead to a helpful increase in your own audience, and it makes for an easy means of spreading your own value.

5 Top YouTube Analytics Tools to Try in 2023
As a content creator on YouTube, measuring the success of your videos is key to improving your content performance and growing your audience.
But, with so many YouTube analytics tools available on the market, choosing the right one can be daunting.
For example, while some tools provide a range of features to optimize videos, such as A/B testing of thumbnails, others don’t offer this feature.
Also, the pricing structure of these tools can be confusing. Some offer only limited features on their basic plans, while others may be too expensive for creators just starting.
So you need an analytics solution that provides the right balance of affordability and functionality.
To help, we have reviewed the top 5 YouTube analytics tools with varying features and pricing.
Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned YouTube content creator, you’ll find a tool that fits your needs, allowing you to make data-driven decisions that improve your content and grow your audience.
Best YouTube Analytics Tools

With TubeBuddy’s Best Time to Publish feature, you can ensure that your videos are released optimally, increasing your YouTube channels’ growth.

5 Top YouTube Analytics Tools to Try in 2023
As a content creator on YouTube, measuring the success of your videos is key to improving your content performance and growing your audience.
But, with so many YouTube analytics tools available on the market, choosing the right one can be daunting.
For example, while some tools provide a range of features to optimize videos, such as A/B testing of thumbnails, others don’t offer this feature.

10 Tips on How to Jump from 500 to 1000 YouTube Subscribers
Are you a creator looking to get your first 1000 YouTube subscribers? Reaching that first thousand subscribers may seem intimidating, but with a plan and effort, it can be accomplished.
You need a minimum of 1,000 YouTube Subscribers (and 4000 hours of watch time)to qualify for YouTube’s Partner Program, so reaching this milestone means you can start monetizing your content on the platform! If you want to make the jump to 1000 subscribers, here are some tips for getting those initial followers that will help jumpstart your channel:
#1 Offer Genuine Value to Your Viewers From the VERY Start
From your very first upload, look for ways for your videos to offer value to your viewers. It’s never too early to get into the mindset that the content you produce needs to be viewer-focused. Whether it’s teaching them something new or entertaining them, make sure your viewers are always getting something out of your videos.
The bottom line is that creating engaging content is essential and non-negotiable for YouTube creators to be successful. To keep viewers coming back, content should be interesting and entertaining. To ensure that viewers remain captivated and keep coming back for more, content must be both intriguing and enjoyable.
Take the time to brainstorm creative ideas that align with your channel’s theme or niche. Think outside the box and come up with unique concepts that haven’t been done before on YouTube
#2 Engage with Your Audience Every Day
Engaging with your audience iskeyto building a loyal following. From the very start of your YouTube journey, take the time to respond to comments on your videos and ask your viewers (even if you just have a handful at the moment) for feedback on what they want to see more of. This not only helps you build a relationship with your viewers, but it also helps you create content that you know they will enjoy.
YouTube is all about interaction and engagement, so make sure you’re engaging with followers regularly on the platform. Reply to comments they leave on posts, ask questions, run polls and surveys – anything that encourages conversation around your content helps keep viewers engaged and interested in what else you have coming up next.
#3 Consistency is Keyto Generating YouTube Subscribers
One of the most important things when it comes to building a successful YouTube channel is consistency. If you want to grow your channel, you need to be posting videos on a regular basis. Whether once a week or three times a week, set a schedule and stick to it.
#4 Make Quality Produced Content
You don’t have to invest thousands of dollars into equipment when you’re just starting, but putting some effort into thinking about your production values will pay dividends from the get-go. Ensure your videos are as well-edited as you can make them and have decent lighting and sound. This is all doable, even if the only camera equipment you have access to is an iPhone.
Don’t underestimate the power of visuals when creating engaging video content; using images and graphics can really bring life to a topic, making it easier for viewers to follow along without getting bored easily (especially if it’s an educational or informational video). Additionally, adding music and sound effects adds another layer of entertainment value which helps keep audiences hooked until the end.
#5 Optimize Your Videos for SEO
Search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial if you want your videos to be discovered by new viewers. Potential subscribers search for topics related to your content; if it’s optimized, they should be able to find you easily. Make sure your video titles, descriptions, and tags are optimized for the keywords that your target audience is searching for.
Using click-worthy custom YouTube thumbnails is an incredibly effective way to grab attention and boost your CTR rate. Read ourthree quick tips to help your custom thumbnails pop on YouTube, and also study your favorite creators for inspiration on their approach.

Collaborations are one of the best ways for YouTube creators to gain exposure from other audiences while creating something new together. Reach out to other influencers on social media networks like Twitter or Instagram to collaborate and discuss ideas for upcoming videos, which can help build your network in the industry.
Take time to identify the right video partner who can help you reach new audiences and provide value in return. Make sure they have a similar style or target audience as you do so that their fans will be interested in what you have to offer too. Also, know the value of what you can offer them, The most successful collaborations are a two-way street.
#7 Promote Your Videos on Social Media
Promoting your videos on social media is a great way to get more eyes on your content. Share your videos across your social media channels and encourage your followers to check them out with a teaser.
Social media platforms are essential for YouTube creators looking to expand their reach and promote their channels. Utilizing these platforms can help you build an audience, engage with viewers, and get your content seen by more people.
Posting links to your videos on social media, with a catchy headline or description and relevant hashtags, is a very effective way to draw attention to your content.
#8 Create a Trailer for Your YouTube Channel
Creating a trailer for your channel is a great way to introduce yourself to new viewers. Ensure your trailer highlights what your channel is all about and encourages viewers to subscribe there and then. Here’s an excellent example of a trailer from the ‘How to ADHD channel that gives the viewer an overview of what they can expect from the creator:
#9 Run a Giveaway or Contest
Running a giveaway or contest is a great way to get more people to subscribe to your channel. Encourage your viewers to subscribe and comment on your videos for a chance to win a prize.
#10 Monitor Analytics & Pop Culture/Industry Trends
Pay close attention to your analytics data, such as likes/dislikes, shares/retweets, etc., which will give you an idea of how successful certain types of posts are performing compared to others. This information can help inform what type of content you produce in order to better reach your desired demographic and increase viewership over time.
Additionally, staying up-to-date with trends across different social networks allows you to create timely content that resonates better with viewers; this could be anything from following popular memes or topics relevant at the time being discussed online through various outlets (e.g, news sites).

Ex-YouTube Employee Reveals How To Grow Your YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram!
Are you a creator who wants to grow on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube by being as efficient as possible with your workflow? We have five tips to help you. Read on to learn the secrets of the top video creators, or watch our video for more information:
#1 Use Trending Audio Tracks for Reels, and Watch Your Instagram Grow
This is a quick but game-changing tip and the biggest thing people miss.Make sure your audio helps your content!
The audio you choose on your Reels can make or break their performance. So next time you’re going to upload a piece of content, look for that up arrow icon next to the sound you’re choosing. Click on it, and make sure it has under 10K videos. That means that the sound is growing quickly and trending, but it’s not oversaturated and too competitive. That means you have the perfect opportunity to jump on it, make a piece of content, and ride the wave.
#2 Find Inspiration for Your Next TikTok Video
Delve into your TikTok watch history to find inspiration for your next video. The feature is totally buried in TikTok’s UI, so follow these steps to find it:
Then you’ll be able to see all the past videos you’ve watched, save them, and then refer back to them when making your new videos for continued inspiration.
#3 Find More Memes and Pop Culture References to Make Your Videos More Gen Z Friendly
This couldn’t be easier! Go toplayphrase.me, and type in any phrase. Its AI will actually find scenes from popular movies and memes using that exact phrase in them. Then just hit the download button and edit those clips into your video to add some pop culture references that will make your video a little more interesting.
#4 Tips for Researching and Storing Video Ideas
This is a hack to make you much more organized, especially if you have too many Chrome tabs open when you’re brainstorming your next video idea. Click right on the tab, select ‘Add to New Group, then you’ll be able to name groups based on the type of research you’re doing. That way, you don’t have to sort through 65 tabs to find something that could make your next video better.
TubeBuddy’s ownVideo Topic Planneralso lets you easily manage and keep track of ideas for future videos. It’s an excellent way to keep all your thoughts, observations, and ideas within the TubeBuddy suite of tools.Sign up for access to this incredibly helpful feature today.
If you want to grow your YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram audiences, put these tips into action today and watch your following grow.
#5 Reach a More Global Audience Even if You Only Speak English

YouTube will index those translated words for people searching in different languages, so you’ll have the opportunity to extend your reach and grow your subscribers.

7 Steps To Make a YouTube Short Blow-Up (Start to Finish)
If you want to go viral on YouTube Shorts, we have a secret formula that you can steal to generate the views you want. You can read through the seven steps you need to follow below or watch our video for more information:
#1 Start With a Killer Idea
If you’ve ever asked yourself, what video should I make, follow the three W’s method:
Ideas are the single most important part of the YouTube equation. For every idea you make, you should have 100 you don’t. In other words, start with more ideas than you can possibly make content about and start sorting through for the most interesting.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#2 Think About What Problem You Are Solving
If you want to create a Short about getting your first 1,000 YouTube subscribers, the problem you are solving is showing other creators how to grow quicker on YouTube. You’re giving them valuable information about subscriber growth and why it’s so important. Your solution to a problemhasto be clear and specific, and relevant to the audience seeking the answer. In this example, we wanted to offer a solution to fixing bad audio, a huge problem for many creators:
#3 What Solution Are You Actually Offering?
How are you getting people to buy into your specific solution for the problem that they’re facing? Are you promoting a solution based on data or insights or from your own experience? Are you reacting to an established but outdated strategy? What’s your hook to get the viewer to click on your Short?
#4 Catch the Viewer with an Awesome Hook
This is one of the most important, if not THE most important, parts of video creation. If you’re watching a YouTube Short or any type of short-form content, you have two to three seconds to capture the viewer’s attention, maybe even less.
How you capture someone’s attention is the difference between them scrolling away and never caring about anything you say or having them stop to stick around to listen to everything you have to say. The hook for getting your first 1,000 subscribers Short might go a little something like this; “If you’re struggling to get your first 1,000 subscribers and you’re feeling frustrated with growing on YouTube, I have a secret you probably didn’t know about!”
Speaking of problems and solutions, if you currently have long-form content on your YouTube channel and you’re not sure what kind of Shorts to make, then leverage what you’ve already published.
if you are a TubeBuddy user, you canfind your best potential YouTube Shortsclips from existing long-form content with ourSuggested Shortstool.
Using AI, our feature finds the moments that generated the highest engagement in seconds, giving you an insight into the actual hook that’s going to work for your Shoty! Find out more about ourSuggested Shorts feature here.
#5 Deliver the Solution You Promise the Viewer
This is the second most important part of making a great Short because the viewer’s looking for any reason to click off if you’re not delivering. The key here,you must deliver.
Let’s build off the hook that we just developed to show you what a message would look like. If you’re struggling to get your first 1,000 subscribers and you’re feeling frustrated with growing on YouTube, I have a secret you probably didn’t know about. The secret is you need to spend more time on your thumbnails and less on video editing. Hook them in and deliver immediately, but do not forget this next part.
#6 Give the Viewer an Example
This shows the audience what they’re currently doing and what they could be doing better. The key here is that you need to show them. It’s important to show, not tell. If you’re showing someone something, they’re much more likely to believe in you. Don’t forget YouTube is a visual platform. In this Short, we gave the viewer real-life examples of YouTube’s new Multi Audio Track feature:
#7 End With an Explanation and a Strong Call to Action

After you give your example, reinforce how something may benefit the viewer or how this is going to help them move forward. Give them the result that they’re looking for and tie it all together.
Also, what do you want them to do next? Subscribe? Watch your next video? Ask them via a call to action. A simple call to action could go like this. If you enjoyed this video and want more strategies for growing your first 1,000 subscribers, make sure to follow for more content just like this.
Now, if we were to put all seven steps together to create a solid YouTube Short, your script would look something like this:
“If you’re struggling to get your first 1,000 subscribers and you’re feeling frustrated with growing on YouTube, I have a secret you probably didn’t know about. The secret is you need to spend more time on your thumbnails and less on video editing. Spending more time on your thumbnail will not only get you more views on your videos, but will also grow your subscriber count because you’re engaging the viewer  and making them want to watch. If you enjoy this video and want more strategies for growing your first 1,000 subscribers, make sure to follow for more content just like this.”
And there you have it. That’s exactly the format that we follow to create that Short. And I guarantee you, if you follow this to a T, you will see the results you desire. It also works for long-form videos too!

The Genius Shortcut to 4000 Hours YouTube Watch Time
As a YouTube creator, you’re probably familiar with the struggle of reaching4000 hours of watch timewithin 12 months to get monetized. Many creators spend years grinding without seeing a penny for their hard work, while others simply give up before they reach that goal. Don’t let that be you.
In this post, we’re going to share a clever tactic that can help you achieve that milestone much faster. It won’t happen overnight, but this is a game-changer. Read on, or watch the following video for more information:
YouTube Shorts and the Watch Time Shortcut
YouTube Shorts have the potential to get a massive amount of views. Unfortunately, those views don’t count towards the 4000 hours of watch time required to monetize using your long-form content.
So how can you use Shorts to your advantage if you’re needing 4000 hours of watch time for your long-form videos? Well, some various smart creators have found a loophole around this. We call it the shortcut strategy, and it is very, very simple.
Let’s unpack this just a little bit more. Look at creatorJohnny Harrisas an example. He made a Short explaininginflation in just 60 seconds, which got over 841,000 views. He then pinned a comment saying, “Of course, this is a very simplified explanation. I made a longer explainer on inflationhere.”
He links to his longer-form video and pushes a meaningful amount of traffic from that Short to his long-form upload. Johnny uses this tactic on many of his Shorts, effectively using Shorts to increase watch time on his long-form content. And it works.
The daily views on that long-form video linked in the example increased by 40% during the first week after that Short went live compared to the previous week and continues to see additional traffic today. We looked into other channels and found similar results.
When a YouTube Short got an increase in views, the long-form video linked in the comments usually experienced a boost in traffic as well. More views, more watch time.
How to Create a Killer YouTube Short to Drive Traffic to Other Videos
But of course, this won’t work if the Short doesn’t take off in the first place. One way to do this is to follow Johnny’s example and take the core idea of one of your long-form videos, then deliver it as a Short. Then the viewers who are thirsty for more can go watch the in-depth video.
However, if you are a TubeBuddy user, you can take the guesswork out of your content andfind your best potential YouTube Shorts clipswith our brand-new Suggested Shorts tool.
Using AI,our toolgives you a solid idea of what part of your long-form video viewers found most interesting. The feature analyzes several of your uploads at once and finds the moments that generated the highest engagement in seconds. Use these insights to craft the idea behind your companion Shorts.
Find out more about ourSuggested Shorts feature here.
The shortcut strategy is not just a great way to squeeze out more watch time or revive a video that’s losing steam, but the traffic you send over to that long-form video is more likely to watch longer.
Hop into the advanced mode of YouTube analytics for one of your past uploads. You’ll notice that traffic sources have a big influence over watch time. For example, the average view duration on your videos might be higher from YouTube suggested than search. That’s because YouTube’s recommendation algorithm is clever and can predict which viewers are more likely to engage with your content.
Search is more of a guessing game and comes down to which result comes first or sticks out to the viewer the most. It is way less personalized. But if a viewer watches your Short, goes to the comments, and decides that based on what they saw, they want to leave the Shorts feed to see the full video, it’s fair to assume that they’ll be more invested in your long-form content than someone who simply stumbled upon it.
And the longer each viewer watches your long-form video, the better it is for your watch time goal of 4000 hours..

The Genius Shortcut to 4000 Hours YouTube Watch Time
As a YouTube creator, you’re probably familiar with the struggle of reaching4000 hours of watch timewithin 12 months to get monetized. Many creators spend years grinding without seeing a penny for their hard work, while others simply give up before they reach that goal. Don’t let that be you.
In this post, we’re going to share a clever tactic that can help you achieve that milestone much faster. It won’t happen overnight, but this is a game-changer. Read on, or watch the following video for more information:
YouTube Shorts and the Watch Time Shortcut
YouTube Shorts have the potential to get a massive amount of views. Unfortunately, those views don’t count towards the 4000 hours of watch time required to monetize using your long-form content.
So how can you use Shorts to your advantage if you’re needing 4000 hours of watch time for your long-form videos? Well, some various smart creators have found a loophole around this. We call it the shortcut strategy, and it is very, very simple.

5 Time-Saving Hacks for YouTubers
Do you have more research, ideas, filming and editing to complete, and community building to do than time to actually do it? Streamlining your workflow process is one of the most effective things you can do to build a successful YouTube presence.
Jon Youshaei, who worked at YouTube and Instagram for eight years, answers your questions about how to become the best creator you can be. In this post, he advises how to save time as a YouTuber. Read his tips below or watch the video for more details:
#1 Use a Video Editing Tool That Doesn’t Require a Huge Learning Curve
Great editing software is going to save you a ton of time. John recommendsDescript, which he likens to Google Docs. It takes audio from any video and changes it into text. By editing that text, you can actually edit the video in real-time, remove sentences or even automatically cut all filler words like “uh” and “um” with a click of a button. And what do you do if you want to add words that you forgot to record? No problem. Just use an overdub feature to add words that you missed. It’s amazing.
#2 Save Time by Re-editing Longer Horizontal videos into TikToks, Shorts, and Reels
TubeBuddy has just released a brand new tool that allows you to repurpose your best long-form content that’s already proven successful for you into new Shorts. It takes the guesswork out of identifying the clips yourself and will save you hours of time that you can put to use elsewhere!You can read full details here and start creating Shorts videos straight away!
John also suggests a free tool calledMunchthat automatically finds the best parts of your long videos, crops them, and cuts them from horizontal to vertical. Just go to the website here, upload your video, and it finds the moment with the highest retention, and within seconds, you’ll have a vertical video ready to post.
#3 Identify the Right Time to Quit Your Job to Become a Full-time Creator
Top YouTube creatorPeter McKinnonactually answered this question perfectly as he spoke about his journey to 5.6 million subscribers:
“It was those little steps along the way that eventually led to the big one, which was knowing it was time to take my chance. You’ve done all of the steps. You could just be doing them forever, or you make the big jump instead of the little steps. And I just decided to do it. I looked at my wife and said, “Let’s play the worst-case scenario.” She’s like, “Okay. We lose the house. We lose our vehicles. We live with our parents full-time in the basement with kids.” And I was like, “I mean, I’m down for that. That doesn’t even sound that bad.” And she’s like, “Let’s do it then. Guess you’re a YouTuber.” And I was like, “Oh, I’m going to change my banner.”
Another top YouTuber,Airrack, actually did the same thing, but by starting his own wedding video company to learn how to make videos before starting a channel that now has nearly over 12 million subscribers
“Every weekend, we would have 12 weddings going on somewhere around the US, every single weekend for an entire year. And so I would hire a couple of people, basically just to manage logistics, and that became what I was doing at 22 – trying to figure out a way to make this video thing scalable. And now, obviously, we’re doing YouTube, which is unlimited scale, which is really cool.”
In short, learn and earn by doing another job before doing it on your own
#4 Look More Professional as a Creator, Especially to Brands
The easiest, most time-saving way to do this is through your Gmail signature! Create a two-by-one table in Google Docs and add your photo to the left box. Then in the right box, add your name, hyperlink all your socials, and change the colors if you want. Then, go to your Gmail setting and paste it in the bottom, and with how many people you’re probably emailing in a day, it’ll be much easier to get clicks on your socials and your videos, especially if you happen to be cold emailing a brand and trying to put your best foot forward when getting a sponsorship.
#5 Respond to Every comment on Your YouTube Videos
This really is a fantastic time-saving tip that is going to save you literally hours. TubeBuddy has a tool that actually lets you createCanned Responsesto YouTube comments, so you’re not repeating yourself hundreds of times when replying.
You can create replies, thank people who subscribed, reply to common questions, or even leave blanks in these canned responses to add the names of people to still keep it personal and write faster than starting from scratch. It’s a huge time saver that makes it easier to engage with your community.Find more about this awesome tool in our how-to video.
We hope these tips help you save valuable time on the basics, leaving you more resources for creating videos and building up your channel.

3 Changes That Will Completely Blow Up Your YouTube Channel
Here are three changes that will absolutely blow up your channel this year. The third one may shock you but bear with us – it could make all the difference to your success on the platform. Read on for our three tips, or watch our video for more information:
#1 Prioritize Upload Consistency Over Perfection
We want you to break the bad habit of not posting. No other tips in this video will work unless you upload. We know the advice about being consistent has been hammered into the ground, but it’s true. Consistency is the foundation of YouTube success.
Think about yourself a year from now. Where do you want to be? How do you want your life to change? The gap between where you are at now and where you want to be can only be bridged by uploading again and again, and again and again, and again and again.
It is going to be hard. You’re going to have to make sacrifices, stay up late, say no to going out with friends, skip the Netflix binges, and even unplug from social media so you can redirect your energy into creation. The pain of discipline is far less than the pain of regret.
#2 Copy Fundamentals but Create Originals
Every time a creator cracks the code of success, it’s only a matter of time before they start to get copied. Ryan Trahan copied. MrBeast copied. Literally, any creator who finds a winning format copied another creator.
Copying isn’t always wrong, it’s when the copying is way too exact that it becomes a potential problem. It is okay to see something that you’re inspired by so you can take it and make it better, or make it different, or give it to your community in your unique way. It’s a problem when the copying isn’t used as a springboard to find your own unique style.
Copy the fundamentals if they interest you but then create your own originals. What fundamentals? The behaviors, habits, and philosophies of successful creators. It is okay to be inspired by successful ideas, but if you really want to blow up, you need to be inspired by successful traits too.
If you want to win likeRyan Trahan, don’t completely steal his format. Steal the creativity it took to come up with it. If you want to be likeMrBeast, don’t copy his style, copy his discipline, dedication, and determination. Those traits, those fundamentals, will make you a successful creator no matter what your style is.
You can also use TubeBuddy’sCompetitor Scorecardtool to compare your channel against your competitors over the last 30 days or longer. This will give you insights into what strategies – or fundamentals – are actually working for those channels so you can take note of them.
#3 Find Mistakes in EVERY Video
So many creators get started, but not many get better over time. They focus on producing and posting, but they never focus on perfecting. The truth is many creators get stuck because they think their content is good enough, but they just haven’t found the right audience. But in reality, the right audience just hasn’t found a video that’s good enough for them.
Viewers will come to your channel when your content is ready. Look back at the early uploads of your favorite creators from when they first started, and genuinely ask yourself, “Would I watch this if they weren’t famous?” Or “Would I subscribe to this channel today?” Most likely, your answer is no. By the time they got your attention, they’d worked out the mistakes that held them back. They got better on camera, better at editing, they got better at storytelling, and the art of producing great content.
So, how can you do this? Well, first, stop thinking that you have it all figured out. You don’t. We all have room to grow. And when you realize that, then ask yourself these four questions:
If more creators ask themselves these questions, they would grow. Optimize what’s right, change what’s wrong, clarify what is confusing, and add what is missing. You need to use these insights to produce your next video and make it better.

3 Changes That Will Completely Blow Up Your YouTube Channel
Here are three changes that will absolutely blow up your channel this year. The third one may shock you but bear with us – it could make all the difference to your success on the platform. Read on for our three tips, or watch our video for more information:
#1 Prioritize Upload Consistency Over Perfection
We want you to break the bad habit of not posting. No other tips in this video will work unless you upload. We know the advice about being consistent has been hammered into the ground, but it’s true. Consistency is the foundation of YouTube success.
Think about yourself a year from now. Where do you want to be? How do you want your life to change? The gap between where you are at now and where you want to be can only be bridged by uploading again and again, and again and again, and again and again.
It is going to be hard. You’re going to have to make sacrifices, stay up late, say no to going out with friends, skip the Netflix binges, and even unplug from social media so you can redirect your energy into creation. The pain of discipline is far less than the pain of regret.
#2 Copy Fundamentals but Create Originals
Every time a creator cracks the code of success, it’s only a matter of time before they start to get copied. Ryan Trahan copied. MrBeast copied. Literally, any creator who finds a winning format copied another creator.
Copying isn’t always wrong, it’s when the copying is way too exact that it becomes a potential problem. It is okay to see something that you’re inspired by so you can take it and make it better, or make it different, or give it to your community in your unique way. It’s a problem when the copying isn’t used as a springboard to find your own unique style.
Copy the fundamentals if they interest you but then create your own originals. What fundamentals? The behaviors, habits, and philosophies of successful creators. It is okay to be inspired by successful ideas, but if you really want to blow up, you need to be inspired by successful traits too.
If you want to win likeRyan Trahan, don’t completely steal his format. Steal the creativity it took to come up with it. If you want to be likeMrBeast, don’t copy his style, copy his discipline, dedication, and determination. Those traits, those fundamentals, will make you a successful creator no matter what your style is.
You can also use TubeBuddy’sCompetitor Scorecardtool to compare your channel against your competitors over the last 30 days or longer. This will give you insights into what strategies – or fundamentals – are actually working for those channels so you can take note of them.

The truth is many creators get stuck because they think their content is good enough, but they just haven’t found the right audience.

How to Get Your First 100 YouTube Subscribers
Are you a YouTube creator looking to get your first 100 subscribers? Reaching that first hundred subscribers may seem intimidating, but with a plan and a good strategy, it can be easily accomplished. Here are some tips for getting those initial followers that will help jumpstart your channel:
#1 Utilize Friends, Family, and Social Media Platforms for Promotion
Let’s start with some easy low-hanging fruit. If you’re lucky enough to have a family and a circle of friends to reach out then do that first. Whilesharing your content with an audience that might not actually careis aterriblelong-term strategy, it will help you get at least some early subscribers, which can be motivating enough for you to carry on with the momentum.
If you have any social media presence, use them to expand your reach and promote your channels. Getting the message out there can help you build an initial audience, engage with your first viewers, and get your content seen by some viewers. Here’s how you can use social media to grow your channel:
Post links to your videos on social media with a catchy headline or description and relevant hashtags, which is an effective way to draw attention. Make sure that the link you post includes an engaging headline or description of the video, so it stands out in people’s feeds. You should also consider using hashtags related to your topic or niche so that people who search for those tags will see your post as well.
Engage with your followers,don’t just broadcast. Social media is all about interaction and engagement, so make sure you’re engaging with followers regularly on each platform. That means replying to comments they leave on posts, asking them questions, or running polls and surveys – anything that encourages conversation around your content helps keep viewers engaged and interested in what else you have coming up next.
Connect with other creators. Collaborations are one of the best ways for YouTube creators to gain exposure from other audiences while creating something new together. Reach out to other influencers on social media networks like Twitter or Instagram to discuss potential collaborations or discuss ideas for upcoming videos, which can help build your network in the industry. This is also a great opportunity for networking within the industry which could lead to even bigger opportunities down the line.But do not hassle or spam!This will only lose you valuable credibility before you’ve even started.
Keep an eye on analytics and trends. Pay close attention to analytics data such as likes/dislikes, shares/retweets, etc., which will give you an idea of how successful certain types of posts are performing compared to others. Additionally, staying up-to-date with trends across different social networks allows you to create timely content that resonates better with viewers; this could be anything from following popular memes or topics relevant at the time being discussed online through various outlets (e.g, news sites).
By taking advantage of these tips when utilizing social media platforms as part of promoting yourself as a YouTube creator, there is no limit to the growth potential for both viewership numbers andpotential revenue streams.
Social media is going to be a major part of your marketing mix as you grow, so the sooner you get comfortable using it, the better. Even the biggest YouTubers in the world still turn toTwitter to alert their followers to new content:
Create the Most Engaging YouTube Content You Can (Even as a Complete Beginner)
Yes, this is advice you’ve heard a thousand times before and is shockingly obvious – but it’s also very true. Creating engaging content is essential for YouTube creators to be successful. To attract YouTube viewers and appeal to them so much that they subscribe to your channel, your content has to be intriguing, informative, interesting, and entertaining.
Brainstorm Ideas.Take the time to brainstorm creative ideas that align with your channel’s theme or niche. Think outside the box and come up with unique concepts that haven’t been done before on YouTube.
Investigate who your intended crowd is to craft content that precisely meets their needs. Use analytics tools like Google Analytics or TubeBuddy’sCompetitor Scorecardto understand what kind of videos they watch, how long they watch them, and which ones get the most engagement from viewers. This information can help inform what type of content you produce in order to better reach your desired demographic and increase viewership over time.
Keep your content fresh.Know that variety is key when it comes to creating engaging video content; don’t just stick with one format or style, as this could become monotonous for viewers after a while. Mix up the content you produce by including tutorials, vlogs, interviews, and Q&As – this will keep viewers entertained with something new each week.
Make your content relevant.Make sure whatever topics you cover are relevant and timely – try not to make it too broad but rather focus on specific issues related directly or indirectly to current events happening in the world today (especially if it relates closely to your niche). This helps ensure that people stay interested in what you have said since it’s more likely going touch upon their interests & passions.
Don’t underestimate the power of visuals when creating engaging video content; using images and graphics can really bring life to a topic, making it easier for viewers to follow along without getting bored easily (especially if it’s an educational or informational video). Additionally, adding music and sound effects also adds another layer of entertainment value which helps keep audiences hooked until the end.
Producing captivating material is the cornerstone of any triumphant YouTube station. Leveraging collaborations with other creators can help you reach your goal of gaining 100 subscribers quickly and efficiently.
Optimize Your YouTube Channel for Subscriber Success
Optimizing your channel for search engine visibility is an essential part of succeeding on YouTube. When potential subscribers search for topics related to your content, they should be able to find you easily. If you can provide the right content for those viewers, there’s every chance they will subscribe to you. To maximize your channel’s visibility, employ strategies such as carefully crafting titles and descriptions that are optimized for search engines.
Use SEO-friendly titles and descriptions.Make sure that the titles and descriptions of all your videos contain relevant keywords so that they can be found by search engines more easily. Utilizing relevant keywords in the titles and descriptions of your videos will make it easier for search engines to locate them, thus boosting organic traffic to your channel and facilitating discovery when people are browsing online.
Utilize Keyword Tags.Tags are a great way to ensure that viewers who may not know about you or what kind of content you produce can still find it through their searches. Be sure to include tags related to the topic of each video in order for them to show up in relevant searches.
Creating playlists of related videosmakes it easy for viewers to find more content on a certain topic without having to conduct another search query, thus helping boost visibility and organic traffic. This allows them to quickly access other related videos without having to conduct another separate search query within YouTube itself. Utilizing this technique will also help boost organic traffic and the visibility of your channel in search engine results. Read more onhow to optimize YouTube playlists for more views.
Using YouTube custom thumbnailsis an effective way to grab attention and differentiate between different types of content (especially within a playlist), thus encouraging further exploration from viewers browsing YouTube’s library pages – which in turn increases the likelihood of being clicked. This will also assist in boosting organic traffic and visibility on search engine results.
A well-structured homepage layout, with easy-to-find categories, makes navigation a breeze and gives visitors the feeling of entering an orderly environment instead of being bombarded by too many choices right off the bat. To make sure important sections like “About Me” are easily accessible to new viewers as soon as they arrive, keep them front and center. Here’s an image of theTubeBuddy YouTube channelas an example of an optimized home page layout:
Starting a YouTube channel can be an exciting and rewarding experience. Generating your first 100 YouTube subscribers can seem like a challenge, but it can be achieved with the right strategy. To begin, focus on creating content that is high-quality and valuable to your target audience. Share your videos on social media and other platforms, engage with your audience, and collaborate with other creators.
Consistency is key, so try to post regularly and make your content visually appealing and engaging. Finally, don’t give up if your growth is slow at first. Keep creating content that you’re passionate about, and be patient – the subscribers will come!

How To DOUBLE Views and Subscribers On YouTube with Trendjacking!
Have you heard of trendjacking? It’s when creators capitalize on trends by making content related to popular topics and the keywords that are associated with them. Jumping on a trend can genuinely boost your video views and subscriber count, and we’re going to show you how.
Creators likeAirrack,Emily D. Baker, and evenMKBHDuse the same strategy to see explosive growth on their channels. And here’s the best part, you don’t have to be a spectacle creator or spend a ton of money on your videos to make this work. The most successful creators we’ve seen use this strategy do it with basic gear from any room in their house. There are plenty of ways thatcreators get more watch time, hours, and subscribers, but this is the method that really works. Read on, or watch our video for more information:
Trendjacking Example: 2023 Super Bowl
February 12th, 2023, was Super Bowl 57. 113 million people tuned in to watch the game. A quick look at Google Trends will show you that people were searching the internet, too (see below). The keyword ‘Super Bowl’ was trending and peaked the day after the game.
The top content posted to YouTube around this time was from the NFL and companies who paid to be a part of Super Bowl commercials. But there was a third group of creators. They posted content related to the Super Bowl in the form of skits, cooking videos, business breakdowns, animations, commentaries, reactions, and so on. This is trendjacking.
These creators capitalized on the trend by focusing their content on the conversations and topics that people were having around the event. So when people searched for Super Bowl or related keywords, their content came up in search results or got recommended to viewers based on their watch history.
These trendjacking creators saw massive growth in watch time and subscribers during and after the Super Bowl. This creator posted the fifth most popular YouTube short related to the Super Bowl in February, and at the time, he only had around 1,700 subscribers. The video has super simple editing and appears to have been filmed in his bedroom, but it still has over 7 million views.
How to Jump on the Trendjacking Trend
Now, let us show you how to do the same. It’s really simple:
Step one: Identify Trends
You have to spot rising trends or anticipate regular trends early. Spotting them is as simple as keeping your eyes and ears open while online. Ask yourself, what are people talking about, or where is attention being drawn to? It’s easy when you’re browsing Reddit, watching the news, scrolling through TikTok, or pretty much doing anything on social media.
A good example is Emily D. Baker. Her channel is about law and pop culture. We first discovered her during the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial. She created content about the trial, and her channel exploded during this period. That’s all because the trial was trending, and people were talking and searching about it nonstop.
Those are examples of rising trends, but anticipating regular trends is actually much easier. All you have to do is look at the calendar and figure out which big tentpole events are coming up, but this time, ask yourself, what will people be talking about or where will attention be drawn to soon? Then plan for it.
The Super Bowl, Oscars, and Olympics are all examples of regular tentpole events you can anticipate. Anything with a set date is easy to plan for, whether it’s a big event, holiday, or even an upcoming release that you know people are going to be interested in.
Step Two: Trendjacking Tailoring
This is the process of taking something that’s trending and tailoring it to fit your unique niche or audience. Now, it’s completely okay if the trend falls outside of your niche. With some creativity, you can find ways to tie it back to what you love to do and make it interesting to your audience and the audience that you want to capture.
It’s time for some examples. Imagine thatMrBeastjust released a new Feastables flavor. He announced it to his 19 million Twitter followers and 137 million YouTube subscribers. You know that people are going to start talking about it, Googling it, and watching videos about it, and within the millions of people who do, plenty of them will be interested in your niche. This is your chance to create content that taps into the trend but also connects to your audience. For example:
The point is you want to take something that people are interested in and searching for, hijack it, and make it work for your niche.
Step Three: Strategic Timing:
This is all about identifying a trend that people will be rushing to YouTube to learn more about. This is something that’s super easy for smaller channels to do. It only requires you to act quickly, and if you do, you will see a huge boost in views, subscribers, and watch time.
The creators who saw the most success with the Super Bowl videos were the ones who posted their content shortly before, during, and shortly after the game while the interest was still high. If they posted the same video today, it wouldn’t nearly have the same impact.
When something goes viral or starts trending,don’t delay.As soon as something big happens in your niche or is a trend that you can tailor back to your niche, Make a video about it immediately. Publish it the same day because if you wait until tomorrow, there are going to be dozens of other creators to compete with. Find a way to twist it and make it work for your niche because a single well-timed video can help you reach all of your monetization requirements, help you get tons of watch time, tons of views, and tons of subscribers, but you have to get on it fast.
You don’t have to do trendjacking forever. It’s just a great way to get attention to your channel fast, especially when you’re new.

7 Painful Truths EVERY Small YouTube Creator Needs To Hear
These are seven painful truths you really need to learn as a YouTuber. You’ll progress faster if you do. Give them some thought so you can move forward with more success than you thought possible. Read ahead for our tips or watch the following video for more info:
#1: YouTube’s Algorithm is NOT Responsible for the Failure of Your Low-quality Content
Sorry, but poor-quality content will not gain traction no matter how hard YouTube pushes it. 99% of the time, if a video flops, there’s a legitimate reason why. Many creators attribute their video’s underperformance to YouTube’s algorithm without fully examining the analytics. The truth usually lies deeper in the data. ReadThe YouTube Algorithm Explained: Top 5 Things You NEED to Knowto understand how the algorithm really works.
#2: Content is Queen, and Thumbnails are King
The best content in the world will always be held back by a poor title or thumbnail. Just like the tastiest food in the world won’t be eaten if it looks unappealing. Now, this is not giving you permission to make a garbage video and make a banger title and thumbnail for it. That’s not going to work. But don’t think that great content alone will attract viewers.
We’ve produced and analyzed countless videos, and we rarely see videos with high retention andwatch timecombined with a low click-through rate do well. Regardless of how many people YouTube recommends the video to, viewers decide to start watching by stopping or clicking because of your title and thumbnail. Then they continue watching because of the content and don’t be deceived by the view count. A highly viewed video with a below-average click-through rate is only an indication that the video had so much more potential. Content is queen, thumbnails are king. It’s a marriage. Both are important. You should optimize for both.
#3: Your Analytics Are More Reliable than your Family, Friends, or Gut Feeling
YouTube Studio provides a comprehensive view of how your audience is engaging and responding to your videos. Regardless of how you feel, the data shows how your viewers feel, and don’t be offended by the facts.
#4: Poor Video Performance is Not a Reflection of You as a Person
It’s a reflection of how well you execute it on that video, and that piece of content is not your next piece of content. When you look at the data objectively and make changes accordingly, your content will improve. Analytics will help you move on from any failures. Look at the data, determined how to improve, then made a better video.
#5: Every Smart YouTube creator is Part Artist and Part Analyst
Artistic creativity is necessary for creating content that is engaging, unique, and memorable. But analytical skills are needed to deeply understand your audience, measure the success of the content, and identify growth opportunities.
Creating better thumbnails, creating better content, digging into data, all this sounds like a lot of work. It is. If you thought that YouTube was just a post-and-go thing, you will quickly realize how much work it is, which is why any YouTuber will tell you, you won’t escape hard work by becoming a creator.
#6: Being a YouTube Creator is a Difficult Job
In many cases, you will work harder than you would in a traditional career role. Small creators have to wear a lot of hats to keep their channels running smoothly. Yes, you are a YouTuber, but you’re also a filmmaker, editor, researcher, graphic designer, writer, and so much more. YouTube is a real job, and it takes real work and commitment to succeed.
Be prepared to put in 10 times the effort you thought you would.
#7: YouTube Longevity has Little to do With Your Subscriber Count
Subscriber counts are just pretty. Views, watch time, and engagements are profitable. You’re going to need a thousand subscribers to get into theYouTube Partner Program. That’s a non-negotiable.
But outside of the YouTube Partner Program and some fancy play buttons, your subscriber count really doesn’t do much. You’re going to need views to make money. You’re going to need watch time to get recommended, and you’re going to need engagement to build a community. A channel with 5,000 subscribers can pull more views than a channel with 50,000. A channel with 1 million subscribers can have less engagement than a channel with hundred thousand. Here’s the thing: Current subscribers do not reflect the current interest in a channel. And with so many niches, CPMs, and ways to make money, it’s a terrible way to gauge income too.
Another painful truth is that some people just won’t like you. That is just a fact. You’re not for everybody, and that’s fine. If you post videos expecting everyone to like them, you’ll quickly be humbled by all the dislikes and comments. Don’t take it personally. This is the nature of being a public figure but be prepared for it. You will work hard to produce content. You will post that content, and then you will receive public feedback. I hope most of it is positive. Negative feedback is unavoidable and will happen, but don’t let the feedback discourage you, especially when you’re new. You’re building in public.
To be great at YouTube, you have to practice in public, video by video. And not going to lie, the video you thought was a banger this year, even you will cringe at next year. Ideas are overrated, execution is everything.
As a content creator, the single most important thing you can do is press publish. Your ideas are useless if they just sit in a notepad. If you’re waiting for the perfect time to execute, you’ll get outdone by somebody else who doesn’t wait. Just post. A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week. The triangle of growth is posting content, getting feedback, then iterating.

I hope most of it is positive. Negative feedback is unavoidable and will happen, but don’t let the feedback discourage you, especially when you’re new. You’re building in public.
To be great at YouTube, you have to practice in public, video by video. And not going to lie, the video you thought was a banger this year, even you will cringe at next year. Ideas are overrated, execution is everything.
As a content creator, the single most important thing you can do is press publish. Your ideas are useless if they just sit in a notepad. If you’re waiting for the perfect time to execute, you’ll get outdone by somebody else who doesn’t wait. Just post. A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week. The triangle of growth is posting content, getting feedback, then iterating.

Update: A Little Swearing on YouTube Won’t Get You Demonetized
YouTube has released a new modernization update, and it’s pretty surprising. Especially as it comes on the heels ofdemonetizing thousands of creators in 2023 over updated advertiser-friendly guidelines. That policy confirmed that any video that contained inappropriate language in the first five seconds couldn’t be monetized via the YouTube Partner Program.
To the surprise of many creators, YouTube decided toreverse some of the monetization changes, and here are the four main updates they just announced:
As of today:🤬 All curse words no longer treated the same✅ Moderate profanity any time can get the green icon⚠️ F-bomb in first 7 seconds, or repeatedly can receive limited ads🎵 Background music with profanity can now get ads🛑 Profanity in title/thumb still can't run adshttps://t.co/Poxu6vJla8
Even better, all the videos that got demonetized because of the initial update are going to be re-reviewed and re-monetized as long as they follow the other policies.
Did You Know?TubeBuddy has aDemonetization Audit toolthat can identify off-limit words in your title, description, or tags that could potentially cause the demonetization of your video.Sign up for access today!
History of Recent YouTube Demonetization Guideline Changes
YouTube often makes changes that creators are not always happy with, like removing the public dislike count in 2021, announcing the controversial Shorts monetization guidelines in 2022, then demonetizing thousands of YouTubers over updated advertiser-friendly guidelines.
That last one really hurt a lot of creators. Overnight, thousands of YouTubers found huge portions of their video catalog demonetized, all because the new update included several new restrictions on what new videos were allowed to earn ad revenue. And also applied to every single video that’s ever been uploaded to YouTube. Do you see how that might be a problem?
Many creators went to sleep making money from years’ worth of videos that they uploaded to YouTube, then woke up demonetized. Unsure about their future and really unsure about what their next move should be. Now, to be honest with you, this update did include some understandable changes like demonetizing videos featuring dangerous or harmful acts that included minors and blocking ads from videos that showcase dishonest behavior. Many advertisers don’t want their content on videos like that, so it’s understandable. That’s not really YouTube’s fault.
Now, there were some changes that creators found absolutely horrid. Mainly the updates around inappropriate language and gameplay violence. Seemingly appropriate gameplay videos suddenly got demonetized for being too gory.
All forms of profanity started being treated equally, like moderate and extreme forms of profanity. Yeah, all of them together, and it became harder to monetize anything with swearing. Then there was the confusing stuff, like not being able to monetize if you use profanity in the first seven seconds of your video. We’re still not sure why seven seconds mattered so much, but you know creators, and you know the internet. They expressed their thoughts and frustrations about these changes in videos, in comments across social media, across the entire internet, and YouTube listened, actually listened.
None of this was the case in the initial update. YouTube actually listened and then responded to creator feedback in a way that wasn’t expected.
Now, the Internet’s going crazy because it is not typical for YouTube to reverse big policies like this. This really goes to show you that your voices do count and that the right kind of feedback and pressure can really make a difference. Watch our video on the new guidelines for more information:
I know it doesn’t seem like the dislike button is returning anytime soon, and we still have the ability to address these changes with the gory gameplay, but I’m sure most of you will agree that this is a step in the right direction and gives creators a better ability to express themselves without restriction.

2 Killer YouTube Audience Retention Hacks THAT WORK
Imagine you can make your videos irresistible so that nobody would dare skip them. Luckily, there are some simple fixes you can make within the first 30 seconds of your videos that can really change how well your videos stand out so they increase your audience retention.
The secret lies in something called the hook, which is the method of grabbing the viewer’s attention in the first few seconds of your video and motivating them to watch the rest of your content. Read on for more of our strategy tips or take a look at our video on this topic:
The Successful YouTuber’s Guide to the Audience Retention ‘Hook’
The best creators use various techniques to build tension, and interest and keep viewers watching, and we’ve learned some really sneaky tricks from them. If you know these, you can finally stop losing tons of viewers during the first few seconds of your upload and start seeing them stick around until the end.
The first one is super helpful, but the second one blew our minds when we first discovered it.
But you need to understand this first. Your video hook is not just what plays when somebody clicks on your video. It is what plays before somebody clicks on your video. That’s because earlier this year, YouTube introduced the inline player. Pretty much this feature allows viewers to watch videos as they browse YouTube. Meaning that even if you master your title and thumbnail, if a viewer pauses just a moment before clicking on your video, your beautiful thumbnail disappears, and the video intro will start playing.We went into detail about this feature in this post.
It’s at this moment where a viewer can choose to keep watching or to keep scrolling. Since auto plays from the inline player count as views, it’s part of the reason why you see huge drop-offs from the first five to 10 seconds of your video. It’s likely that those viewers never even clicked on the video. They watched the intro in the feed, didn’t get hooked by the content, and kept scrolling. That’s why creators invest so much time planning and editing their intros because they know it’s the difference between keeping or losing a huge portion of their audience.
#1 YouTube Audience Retention Hack: The Cold Open
So, what’s the first trick top creators use? You see it all the time on TV, in movies, and on YouTube. It’s a trick being used in the first scene of Breaking Bad. It’s the same trick creators likeColin and Samiruse when their interview episode starts with the guest saying something surprising. Like Miker Rober in the following video:
There’s a reason why this cold open technique works so well. It’s because the cold open creates a sense of mystery. The viewer is left wondering what the heck happened in that scene, and they’re motivated to keep watching to find out. It’s the practice of jumping directly into a story at the beginning of the show on a theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of them switching during the opening commercial.
For creators, this means reducing the likelihood that that viewer will choose to go to a different video. You want your viewers to say oh, I have to see this. They can be jokes, action scenes, or skits. However, there’s one style of cold open that always seems to grab people’s attention and keep them watching, and that’s the flash forward. This is a cold open that teases the later events of your video. By doing this at the beginning of your video, you get viewers excited about upcoming events, and it’s a great strategy for getting a viewer to click into your video from the inline player if they had any hesitation.
#2 YouTube Audience Retention Hack: What’s at Stake?
There’s an even more powerful technique that creators use in their videos, and once you discover what it is, you will see it everywhere. Check out the first 20 seconds of this video and see if you can spot it?
Did you notice? Let’s go back. Ryan’s dad bet he couldn’t survive a sensory deprivation tank because Ryan has a screen time problem, and they agreed whoever lost the bet would face a consequence. Which, if you think about it, wasn’t necessary for the challenge. It was a clever way of raising the stakes. It’s simply introducing risk, impact, and rewards into the story that gives viewers another reason to care about the outcome.
By introducing stakes, you’re telling the viewer that there’s something to be lost or gained as a consequence of the outcome of your story. Maybe you didn’t care about the sensory deprivation tank, but now you care to see if Ryan can break his phone addiction. Who will win the bet? Maybe you want to see the loser go through the punishment.
We use this example because it’s super subtle. It’s not extremely obvious. It’s easy to look at aMrBeast videoand see the stakes. There’s a lot of money and prizes on the line, but creators like Ryan do this in ways that you barely even notice.
Do you see how all of this adds some pressure and curiosity to see the outcome? Stakes are everywhere. YouTube creators use stakes to hook viewers into watching until the end to see if the characters win or lose, learn something, or achieve their goals.
There are so many things that creators do and don’t do that might seem simple on a surface level, but when you go deeper, there are layers of storytelling that get viewers to commit.

How To Get Ahead Of 99% Of YouTubers (In 6-12 Months)
Do you want to get ahead of 99% of YouTubers in the next six to 12 months? Of course, you do!
So every video you post from this day forward has to have big YouTuber energy. You know those channels that get comments like, “wow, I expected this channel to have more subscribers.” You want that channel to be yours. You want viewers to watch your channel and not even realize that your subscriber account might only be at a hundred, and that requires you to approach YouTube with a set of attitudes and actions that will put you in the top 1% of creators. Read on for our ground-breaking tips or watch the video below:
How to Get Ahead of Your YouTube Competitors
Let’s useAirrackas an example. In 2020, it was one of the fastest-growing YouTube channels and successfully obtained 1 million subscribers in under a year. This was not luck. From the very beginning, Eric had these three attitudes.
And his actions matched those mindsets. Not only did he produce some of the best content on YouTube at the time, but he also created content that never even existed. This doesn’t mean that he used expensive gear or had a full production crew behind his videos. He just thought outside the box. He put a tremendous amount of effort into all of his videos, from the scripting to the storytelling to the editing to engaging with this audience.He wasrelentlessin his video release schedule and committed to posting once a week even if the video was not perfect, and he went 100% in on YouTube and held nothing back. His channel has now generated an incredible 1.7B views!
Start Small but Aim REALLY BIG
Having just 10 YouTube subscribers is so hard. But with a successful mindset and a killer urge to succeed, there’s no chance on earth that you won’t eventually achieve your goal – even if that’s just to hit the next subscriber target.
Most new channels simply are not approaching YouTube this way. Small growing channels increase their effort as their subscriber count increases. But fast-growing channels max out their effort as soon as they launch. They start with their biggest ideas. They collaborate early, they make noise they fake it until they become it.
Maybe you’re not natural on camera. Maybe you’re afraid to speak in public. Maybe you’re ashamed to reach out to brands and creators because you only have 30 subscribers. Maybe you don’t even have a full grasp on what you want your channel to be about, and that’s okay. Being a creator comes with a skill and confidence that is not easily mastered, but when the camera’s rolling, it’s time to put the fear and nervousness aside and become the biggest version of yourself.
It might feel unnatural at first – speaking to the camera like there are a million people watching, even if there’s nobody. Don’t act like you have 30 subscribers. Act like you have 3 million.
One of the worst things you can do is let your inexperience and nervousness show up on camera. Carry yourself with the confidence of the creator that you want to become. Observe the masses and do the opposite. When everyone is copyingMrBeast’s style, create your own style. When creators are stealing ideas, make something original. When everyone is playing it safe, get creative and take risks.
Your YouTube Channel is Not Going to Blow Up if You Stay Safe
To be in the 1% of creators, you have to think and act differently. Your channel is not going to blow up by doing the same thing as everybody else. This isn’t advice about being yourself or finding your voice. This is about standing out from the pack and making it clear that you are in a different category of creators.
Who created content likeMichelle Kharebefore Michelle Khare? Who created content likeRyan Trehanbefore Ryan Trehan?
Who created content like you, before you?
Hopefully, your answer is nobody. This means that you have no competition. You are not just creating lower-quality versions of what’s already out there. You’re creating something completely new. This means you’re sitting in your own blue ocean. Meanwhile, everyone is fishing in a red ocean. There are millions of channels doing tech, fitness, gaming, beauty, and every topic under the sun. It’s not enough to be just as good or even better than the rest. You have to be different. Close the gap, and the only way to close that gap is by upgrading your skills.
You watch YouTube tutorials on lighting, editing, and camera angles. You study your favorite creators and try to learn from their techniques. You invest in better gear when you can. You seek feedback from your audience and creators, and you apply what you learn to improve your videos.
You find that channels that plateau are not focused on closing the gap. They’re hyper-focused on posting content, not perfecting it. In six months to a year from now your channel could be in an entirely different spot. This feeling that you have right now that you’re gonna blow up that you’re going be the best creator in the world that you can make it,hold on to that feeling. But remember this, ideas are worthless. Execution is everything.
If you really want this, start today, and don’t stop. Post at least one video per week as you learn the craft and build momentum. Have big YouTuber energy and confidence. Start before you’re ready, stop competing, and start carving out your own lane. And most importantly, press record.

6 Ways to Generate 4,000 Hours of YouTube Watch Time FASTER!
If you’re a YouTube creator who wants to monetize your content through Adsense revenue, you’ll need to have generated1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch timeon your channel over the last 365 days. We’ll be covering subscriber growth in-depth in a future post, but for now, let’s focus on watch time and the importance of building it through your content.
4,000 hours watch time = 240,000 minutes.
That’s a lot of minutes, but we’re going to give you some solid advice on how to get your videos watched by more people and get you to that goal faster. We’ll also let you know which TubeBuddy tools will help you.
Need a visual tutorial?Watch our videoto make sure you’re doing everything correctly when it comes to watch time:
#1 Video Length and YouTube Watch Time
You may think that the longer your video, the higher the watch time hours.
That’s just not true and may even backfire if your analytics are reporting that viewers are dropping out before the end of the video. YouTube is looking at those metrics, and the more viewers who abandon your content, the less likely YouTube is to serve it up to more people on the platform.
It may be a much more successful strategy to create shorter videos that people watch longer than making a long video where people click out only 20% of the way through.
How long do your videos need to be? The answer is as long as they need to be to get the point across. Being able to condense and package up your videos in the shortest amount of time possible will significantly benefit you.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#2 What’s the Deal With YouTube Shorts and Watch Time?
If we’re suggesting that you make your videos as concise as possible, should you be creating Shorts content instead of longer-form videos? Not necessarily.
Any subscribers you gain from your Shorts will count towards your goal of reaching 1,000 (the other metric you need to qualify to join theYouTube Partner Program and become eligible for monetization).
BUTthe watch time generated by YouTube Shorts, especially if they’re served to viewers via the Shorts shelf, will not count towards your 4,000 hours needed. So keep creating Shorts if that’s the kind of content you love to do, but remember they won’t contribute to an increase in watch time.
#3 Audience Retention Metrics are Your Friend
If you have been publishing videos to your channel, you’ll have some performance data to work with, giving you feedback on how your content resonates with viewers.
There are several tools that both YouTube and TubeBuddy have that can help you with things like audience retention and drop-off rate.
On YouTube, you can access your audience retention analytics via YouTube Studio. Just click on a published video and click ‘Analytics.’ From the new dashboard, click on ‘Engagement’ to access the data you need. Look out for ‘Typical Audience Retention’ and ‘Key Moments for Audience Retention‘ metrics. We’ll be taking a deeper dive into these reports in a future post.If you have aTubeBuddy Legend or Enterprise account, you have access to our‘Retention Analyzer’ report, which will tell you how many people are still watching your video at various time intervals, e.g., 30 seconds or 60 seconds in.
If you see a dramatic cutoff in retention, you should address that in your content strategy. Think about the types of videos you’re making or how long the videos are. Keep a very close eye on audience retention after you’ve published a video to see where improvements can be made.
#4 Publish Your Videos When Your Audience is Online
When you publish a video, you want to ensure that as many viewers see it as possible. One metric that will be invaluable for you is knowing when your viewers are online and where most of your viewers are watching.
For instance, if you’re based in the United States, but most of your viewers are based in Japan,  you should publish in Japan Standard Time to leverage those potential viewers and subscribers.
If you want to know when the best time to publish is,TubeBuddy has a toolthat can help you with this exact metric, and it’s available to anyone with a license.
Go to your YouTube Studio and open the TubeBuddy icon at the top right, then scroll down to ‘Extension Tools’ and click on ‘Best Time To Publish.’ You’ll be redirected to the ‘Audience’ tab of YouTube Studio Analytics. On this dashboard, scroll down to the ‘When your viewers are on YouTube’ section.
Just below YouTube’s graph, you can see recommendations from TubeBuddy about when to publish your next video. It even tells you the best time to live stream!
Why is publishing time so important?The first 24 hours after you’ve published a video are the most crucial for a creator. If a new video gets some good traction with initial views, engagements, and watch time, this sends a strong signal to YouTube that your video is performing well. This may lead to it being promoted to new viewers.
#5 Make the Most of End Screens, Info Cards, and Playlists
Info cardsandend screensare two fantastic YouTube features that allow you to link to other videos (and much more). This can give your viewers more context on a topic you’re discussing or can enable you to promote more of your content. So if you’re not taking advantage of either of these extras, make a start today!
While many creators use end screens and info cards to send people to a specific video, did you know that you can also add a playlist as a link? Why not create a playlist of the videos that have gained you the most subscribers to leverage that content.
This is an important strategy for generating extra watch time for your channel. YouTube rewards video content that keeps viewers on the platform for as long as possible. In addition, guiding viewers to a curated and relevant Playlist will help raise your watch time.
#6 Use Comments to Drive Engagement
When it comes to comments on your YouTube videos, it always pays to respond in a timely manner, especially in the first few hours after publishing. So why not create a canned response comment that includes a link to your most popular video or a playlist of videos on a similar topic to drive engagement and more watch time and views?
You can also create canned responses with open-ended questions to generate more conversation. Such as:
Very often, when viewers get a notification that you have responded, they come back to your video and maybe watch it again, which leads to even more engagement.
If you are on thefree levelof TubeBuddy, you get onecanned responseavailable to you. If you’re on thePro level or higher, then you get as many canned responses as you want.
Just go to your YouTube Studio and open the TubeBuddy icon at the top right, then scroll down to ‘Website Tools’ and click on ‘Canned Responses’.  Then you can add in your own.
YouTube Watch Time and Your Channel
Generating 4,000 hours of watch time may feel like a daunting task, but it can easily be achieved if you spend time on your content and promotion strategies. The most important tip we can give is:
Make your videos easy to watch and give viewers a reason to subscribe to your channel.
If you continue to show up, publish videos, and work on improving production and content, you will reach your 4,000 hours, and we will be here to celebrate your success!

6 Ways to Generate 4,000 Hours of YouTube Watch Time FASTER!
If you’re a YouTube creator who wants to monetize your content through Adsense revenue, you’ll need to have generated1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch timeon your channel over the last 365 days. We’ll be covering subscriber growth in-depth in a future post, but for now, let’s focus on watch time and the importance of building it through your content.
4,000 hours watch time = 240,000 minutes.
That’s a lot of minutes, but we’re going to give you some solid advice on how to get your videos watched by more people and get you to that goal faster. We’ll also let you know which TubeBuddy tools will help you.
Need a visual tutorial?Watch our videoto make sure you’re doing everything correctly when it comes to watch time:
#1 Video Length and YouTube Watch Time
You may think that the longer your video, the higher the watch time hours.
That’s just not true and may even backfire if your analytics are reporting that viewers are dropping out before the end of the video. YouTube is looking at those metrics, and the more viewers who abandon your content, the less likely YouTube is to serve it up to more people on the platform.
It may be a much more successful strategy to create shorter videos that people watch longer than making a long video where people click out only 20% of the way through.
How long do your videos need to be? The answer is as long as they need to be to get the point across. Being able to condense and package up your videos in the shortest amount of time possible will significantly benefit you.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#2 What’s the Deal With YouTube Shorts and Watch Time?
If we’re suggesting that you make your videos as concise as possible, should you be creating Shorts content instead of longer-form videos? Not necessarily.
Any subscribers you gain from your Shorts will count towards your goal of reaching 1,000 (the other metric you need to qualify to join theYouTube Partner Program and become eligible for monetization).
BUTthe watch time generated by YouTube Shorts, especially if they’re served to viewers via the Shorts shelf, will not count towards your 4,000 hours needed. So keep creating Shorts if that’s the kind of content you love to do, but remember they won’t contribute to an increase in watch time.
#3 Audience Retention Metrics are Your Friend
If you have been publishing videos to your channel, you’ll have some performance data to work with, giving you feedback on how your content resonates with viewers.
There are several tools that both YouTube and TubeBuddy have that can help you with things like audience retention and drop-off rate.
On YouTube, you can access your audience retention analytics via YouTube Studio. Just click on a published video and click ‘Analytics.’ From the new dashboard, click on ‘Engagement’ to access the data you need. Look out for ‘Typical Audience Retention’ and ‘Key Moments for Audience Retention‘ metrics. We’ll be taking a deeper dive into these reports in a future post.If you have aTubeBuddy Legend or Enterprise account, you have access to our‘Retention Analyzer’ report, which will tell you how many people are still watching your video at various time intervals, e.g., 30 seconds or 60 seconds in.
If you see a dramatic cutoff in retention, you should address that in your content strategy. Think about the types of videos you’re making or how long the videos are. Keep a very close eye on audience retention after you’ve published a video to see where improvements can be made.
#4 Publish Your Videos When Your Audience is Online
When you publish a video, you want to ensure that as many viewers see it as possible. One metric that will be invaluable for you is knowing when your viewers are online and where most of your viewers are watching.
For instance, if you’re based in the United States, but most of your viewers are based in Japan,  you should publish in Japan Standard Time to leverage those potential viewers and subscribers.
If you want to know when the best time to publish is,TubeBuddy has a toolthat can help you with this exact metric, and it’s available to anyone with a license.
Go to your YouTube Studio and open the TubeBuddy icon at the top right, then scroll down to ‘Extension Tools’ and click on ‘Best Time To Publish.’ You’ll be redirected to the ‘Audience’ tab of YouTube Studio Analytics. On this dashboard, scroll down to the ‘When your viewers are on YouTube’ section.
Just below YouTube’s graph, you can see recommendations from TubeBuddy about when to publish your next video. It even tells you the best time to live stream!
Why is publishing time so important?The first 24 hours after you’ve published a video are the most crucial for a creator. If a new video gets some good traction with initial views, engagements, and watch time, this sends a strong signal to YouTube that your video is performing well. This may lead to it being promoted to new viewers.
#5 Make the Most of End Screens, Info Cards, and Playlists
Info cardsandend screensare two fantastic YouTube features that allow you to link to other videos (and much more). This can give your viewers more context on a topic you’re discussing or can enable you to promote more of your content. So if you’re not taking advantage of either of these extras, make a start today!
While many creators use end screens and info cards to send people to a specific video, did you know that you can also add a playlist as a link? Why not create a playlist of the videos that have gained you the most subscribers to leverage that content.
This is an important strategy for generating extra watch time for your channel. YouTube rewards video content that keeps viewers on the platform for as long as possible. In addition, guiding viewers to a curated and relevant Playlist will help raise your watch time.
#6 Use Comments to Drive Engagement
When it comes to comments on your YouTube videos, it always pays to respond in a timely manner, especially in the first few hours after publishing. So why not create a canned response comment that includes a link to your most popular video or a playlist of videos on a similar topic to drive engagement and more watch time and views?
You can also create canned responses with open-ended questions to generate more conversation. Such as:
Very often, when viewers get a notification that you have responded, they come back to your video and maybe watch it again, which leads to even more engagement.
If you are on thefree levelof TubeBuddy, you get onecanned responseavailable to you. If you’re on thePro level or higher, then you get as many canned responses as you want.
Just go to your YouTube Studio and open the TubeBuddy icon at the top right, then scroll down to ‘Website Tools’ and click on ‘Canned Responses’.  Then you can add in your own.
YouTube Watch Time and Your Channel
Generating 4,000 hours of watch time may feel like a daunting task, but it can easily be achieved if you spend time on your content and promotion strategies. The most important tip we can give is:
Make your videos easy to watch and give viewers a reason to subscribe to your channel.

How to Find the Right YouTube Channel Niche (For You!)
Pop quiz. What’s Your YouTube Channel Actually About?
Can you give a clear, confident answer? Not having a focus is like driving a bus without having any idea of the destination. You’ll end up going in circles and eventually run out of gas. Plus, what subscribers go into hop on a bus that they don’t even know where it’s going?
Early on is okay to bounce around from topic to topic until you find the content that you’re attracted to. But at some point, you need to settle down and commit. Don’t make the mistake of thinking your channel can be about anything and everything. Those are the hardest channels to grow because who is YouTube going to recommend a channel that is sometimes about fitness and sometimes about family and sometimes about gaming and unboxing and the last vacation you took?
Read on for more information or take a look at our video on the subject below:
Your YouTube Channel Needs a CLEAR Focus on a Niche
If you want to start seeing growth and pulling in acommunity of subscriberswho jam with every single video you make, you need focus. And while this could be a super in-depth video about finding your passion and all that good stuff, let’s focus on two main steps that you can take right now to bring consistency to your channel and make it much easier to grow.
#1 Step One: As a YouTube creator, you’re like the producer of your own network, and every great TV network has a focus.
And that focus gives its channel its identity. So think big picture. What kind of network are you? Do you want to build a network like ESPN, where sports is the primary focus? Or maybe you want to build something like Discovery Channel, where science and nature are the focus? There are plenty of examples. YouTube even gives you hand-picked categories to choose from when you’re setting up your channel.
This even works if you want to build your network around vlogging or lifestyle. While many creators may have lots of different content on their channels, everything ladders up to the broad topics that they chose.
Whatever you choose should be specific enough that it gives you clear direction but broad enough that you have plenty of flexibility and content to work with. Having this focus gives your channel structure and makes it much easier to do step number two.
# Step Two: You’ve got to plant your shelves in your series
Okay, Mr. Big TV producer, you’ve got your network. Now it’s time to start programming it with content. A lot of creators start to bury their channels here, by posting all sorts of random content that doesn’t relate to or fit with the theme of their channel.
This type of approach creates a cycle where one video might pull a subscriber in, but then the next one pushes them back out. And this has nothing to do with you, it’s just not the kind of content that they’re interested in. While some viewers might enjoy both types of content and stick around, as the producer of your own YouTube channel, you need to choose complementary topics. These are topics that are related to your main focus but approach it from different angles that give the channel variety.
The key is for them to work together.
For instance,MKBHD:core topic, tech reviews,complimentary topics, smartphones, laptops, and other content, high tech vehicles,Browney:core topic, fitness,complimentary topics, fitness challenges, transformations, and public fitness competitions.
Yes, occasionally, you can go off in other directions, but this is your core, and these sub-topics complement your channel without sacrificing variety. It also makes it easier to come up with new ideas since you always have a point to start from. And over time, you can experiment with new buckets to see how they perform.

3 Shocking Ways YouTubers Are Destroying Their Channels Without Realizing It!
If you’re serious about growing your YouTube channel, generating more views, subscribers, andrevenue, there are some really awesome ways that you can use to promote yourself and get your content out there into the world.
But that’s not what this post is about. This post is about three super dangerous, very sketchy, downright useless tactics for promoting your YouTube videos that you might be doing because you think it’s the right thing to do. Before you take any more action, read our post or catch up on the following video:
3 Ways You Are Destroying Your YouTube Channel
#1 Not Leaving An Actual Link to Your Video on Social Media Platforms
We always thought it was weird when YouTube creators promoted their videos on social media without leaving the link to the video. It seemed inconvenient to make subscribers manually open a new tab and search for the video when the creator could have just embedded it for us.
We did the same thing on our social media accounts, never really understanding why. When you post links to your YouTube videos on social media sites, it usually gets embedded in the browser window so that they can just watch the video even if signed out of YouTube. Even though you might get more views this way, that viewer isn’t signed in, and that’s the problem.
It means the video doesn’t go into the viewer’s watch history!
So when they go to YouTube, and your video gets recommended to them because they have already seen it on Twitter or Facebook, Discord, or somewhere else, they’re going to choose not to watch it again, and we know what happens next. If people see your video on YouTube and then choose not to watch it, that’s going to hurt yourclick-through rateand send signals to YouTube that viewers aren’t interested in your content.
So the best practice is, instead of sharing embedded links, just tell your viewers that you uploaded, and the dedicated ones will happily retrieve it themselves.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
Or you can do what we do. We add our thumbnails to the social post so that the embedded video will get replaced by the thumbnail, but the link will still be there. And instead of your viewer being able to watch the video externally, they’ll be redirected to the YouTube app when they click on it, where the video will be added to their watch history, and they’ll be able to like, leave comments, and watch the next one.

#2 Sharing Your Content with an Audience That Doesn’t Actually Care
This might sound harsh, but you need to hear this. The truth is not everybody cares about your content. That includes your mom, your dad, your grandma, your grandpa, your aunt, your uncle, your old friend from high school, or that person you met at the cookout. And that’s fine because not everybody is your audience. Sure, they might watch your gaming video, your vlog, and your new cooking video because they love you. They want to support you, not because granny is some kind of hardcore gamer, or Bill just loves makeup now. They’re just supporting you and being nice. They might click and watch the link because you spammed it in the group chat, but ask yourself these questions.
Is the audience I shared this with really interested in my content?
When YouTube looks at this viewer’s watch history, will it give them good data about other content my target audience is interested in? And is it likely that this person would watch this video if they saw it on YouTube and didn’t know I made it?
If the answer to any of those questions is no, it might not be worth sharing it with them. It might not be worth asking them to subscribe because, let’s be honest. In the long run, you want to work on building an audience that’s really interested in what you’re creating, who watch until the end, engage in comments, or join your communities of people with shared interests and support you financially by becoming members,buying merch, or getting your course.
#3 Buying Subscribers
Buying subscribers and exchanging subs with your fellow creators might drive up your subscriber count, but as we know, that’s not the only important thing here. For starters, any form of fake engagement is against YouTube’s community guidelines. You could get your channel yeeted off YouTube!
Even if you’re still tempted to risk it, these subscriber-boosting scams are just that: scams. They lead one of your channel metrics to increase but to the detriment of other key analytics. Things like engagement, likes, and monetization won’t grow when you’re paying for subscribers who ultimately aren’t interested in the content or what you’re selling.

3 Shocking Ways YouTubers Are Destroying Their Channels Without Realizing It!
If you’re serious about growing your YouTube channel, generating more views, subscribers, andrevenue, there are some really awesome ways that you can use to promote yourself and get your content out there into the world.
But that’s not what this post is about. This post is about three super dangerous, very sketchy, downright useless tactics for promoting your YouTube videos that you might be doing because you think it’s the right thing to do. Before you take any more action, read our post or catch up on the following video:
3 Ways You Are Destroying Your YouTube Channel
#1 Not Leaving An Actual Link to Your Video on Social Media Platforms
We always thought it was weird when YouTube creators promoted their videos on social media without leaving the link to the video. It seemed inconvenient to make subscribers manually open a new tab and search for the video when the creator could have just embedded it for us.
We did the same thing on our social media accounts, never really understanding why. When you post links to your YouTube videos on social media sites, it usually gets embedded in the browser window so that they can just watch the video even if signed out of YouTube. Even though you might get more views this way, that viewer isn’t signed in, and that’s the problem.
It means the video doesn’t go into the viewer’s watch history!
So when they go to YouTube, and your video gets recommended to them because they have already seen it on Twitter or Facebook, Discord, or somewhere else, they’re going to choose not to watch it again, and we know what happens next. If people see your video on YouTube and then choose not to watch it, that’s going to hurt yourclick-through rateand send signals to YouTube that viewers aren’t interested in your content.
So the best practice is, instead of sharing embedded links, just tell your viewers that you uploaded, and the dedicated ones will happily retrieve it themselves.

And instead of your viewer being able to watch the video externally, they’ll be redirected to the YouTube app when they click on it, where the video will be added to their watch history, and they’ll be able to like, leave comments, and watch the next one.

3 Mind-Blowing Chat GPT Hacks for Small YouTubers!
Chat GPThas set the Internet on fire, and that’s fantastic news for smaller YouTube channels.
The power of Chat GPT is that it can help you generate creative and unique video ideas. The kind that can take you from just getting a few views to completely blowing up your channel.
Read on to understand the power of artificial intelligence (AI), or take a look at our video, which will give you three fantastic hacks for the AI tool:
What is Chat GPT and Why Should YouTubers Care?
Chat GPT is a chatbot (or “bot”) powered by artificial intelligence (AI). You can prompt it to write essays or scripts, have a conversation with you on a specific subject, create recipes and resumes, and a thousand other things.
Best of all, Chat GPT is currently completely free and will 100% help you make videos that willearn you more moneyand subscribers while saving you a ton of time.
Three Insane Chat GPT Hacks for Small YouTubers
Want to know what to do when you need a killer YouTube video idea using Chat GPT? There are three methods here:
Want to know what to do when you need a killer YouTube video idea using Chat GPT? There are three methods here:
#1 The first method is to take inspiration.
Go and find the top creators in your niche or even just a few that inspire you. Then make a list of their top videos, or best videos from the last 30 to 90 days, to get an idea of what’s currently working for them. For this example, let’s pretend that you have a self-improvement adventure-style channel.
Look at some of the top favorites likeNathaniel DreworYes Theory. Then add five or so of their videos to a list. This list is important. This is what you’re going to feed Chat GPT to kind of guide it in the direction that you want to go.
Then go to Chat GPT and talk to it like you’re talking to a friend. Use phrases such as “Hey, can you help me come up with ideas for videos like the ones on this list?” Chat GPT will respond with an answer like, “Sure, I’d be happy to help you come up with ideas for videos. Could you please provide me with the list you’re referring to, so I can get a better sense of the type of videos you’re interested in creating?” So, copy, paste, and hit enter. Chat GPT will start generating video ideas for you that are similar to the things that are already working in your niche but with a unique twist. How cool is that?
#2 Method two is to remix your existing videos:
Honestly, the existing content in your channel could be just a gold mine for ideas. Go through your library and look for the best-performing content. If you’re a smaller channel, specifically look at the videos that are attracting the newest subscribers andwatch timehours.
To find out this info, go to YouTube analytics, tap Advanced Mode, then change the date range to last 30 to 90 days. Then take a look at the top videos for either Watch Time or Subscribers.
Now make a list of a few of them, and throw them into Chat GPT, but this time we’re just going to use them as inspiration to remix the videos that your subscribers are already falling in love with. Literally, ask Chat GTP, “My YouTube channel is doing well with these videos. Can you suggest new ones in the same style?” Copy and paste that list, then hit enter. This time Chat GPT will give you winning ideas personalized to your channel.
#3 Method three is just to freestyle:
We love giving Chat GPT examples from past videos that perform well just to give it some context and help guide it into the direction of video ideas that are already resonating with our audience. But sometimes, it’s just fun to freestyle.
We make highly detailed requests like this, “Give me 10 video ideas for an entertainment YouTube channel about finance that would invoke the feeling of curiosity. Each title should be under 70 characters.” Or “I need 10 video ideas for a fitness channel that would invoke the sense of fear about workout mistakes. Each title should be under 70 characters long.”
This time it gave us ideas such as “The Dangerous Consequences of Bad Form.” “Stop These Workout Mistakes Before It’s Too Late.” and “The Hidden Risk of Popular Exercises.”
You can reverse engineer any successful content into new hits, Once you create your perfect video idea, start over with Chat GTP to repeat the winning process!

7 Basic Things Every New Video Creator Needs to Know
Creating a YouTube channel can be a fun ride for any creator and an excellent way to share your skills, hobbies, lifestyle, or opinions with the world. However, it can also be intimidating if you’re not sure where to start. Here are seven fundamental things every new video creator needs to know:
#1 Plan Your Video Content BEFORE You Start Filming
It’s incredibly important to have a clear idea of what you want to create. Consider your target audience, the purpose of your videos, and the type of content you want to produce. You should also decide on a consistent posting schedule and plan out yourcontent calendarin advance to ensure that you have a steady stream of material to share with your viewers.
#2 Invest in Decent Video, Audio, and Lighting Equipment
While you don’t need the most expensive equipment to start a YouTube channel (and you certainly shouldn’t invest before deciding it’s the right thing for you),  it’s important to consider decent-quality gear that will produce fairly high-quality videos. A good camera, microphone, and lighting setup will make a big difference in the final product.
#3 Learn Basic Video Editing
Even if you don’t have a lot of experience with video editing, it’s important to learn the basics. Simple software like iMovie or Adobe Premiere Elements can help you create professional-looking videos with minimal effort.
#4 Engage With Your Growing Audience
YouTube success is all about engaging with your audience and building your community. Building a relationship with your viewers and potential subscribers is essential to success, so respond to comments and questions, ask for feedback, and engage with your audience through live streams and other interactive content. This will help you build a community of loyal followers who are more likely to watch and share your videos.
#5 Monetize Your YouTube Videos
As soon as you hit1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time, enable monetization on your channel and link it to an AdSense account. You can also monetize your content throughsponsorships, paid promotions, or merchandise sales.
#6 Understand and Abide by YouTube’s Guidelines
It’s important to familiarize yourself with YouTube’s guidelines and policies to ensure that your content complies with the platform’s rules. This includes guidelines on copyright, community standards, and advertising policies.
#7 Keep Learning From Other YouTube Creators
There are many successful creators on YouTube who are willing to share their experiences and advice with new creators. Look for creators in your niche and subscribe to their channels to get inspiration and insights into what works on the platform. You can also join creator communities and forums (like TubeBuddy’s own Discord Server) to connect with other creators and learn from their experiences.
By following these tips, you can get started on your YouTube journey with confidence. Remember that success on YouTube takes time and effort, and it may take some trial and error to find what works best for your channel. However, with dedication and hard work, you can build a successful YouTube channel and share your passions with a wide audience.

7 Basic Things Every New Video Creator Needs to Know
Creating a YouTube channel can be a fun ride for any creator and an excellent way to share your skills, hobbies, lifestyle, or opinions with the world. However, it can also be intimidating if you’re not sure where to start. Here are seven fundamental things every new video creator needs to know:
#1 Plan Your Video Content BEFORE You Start Filming
It’s incredibly important to have a clear idea of what you want to create. Consider your target audience, the purpose of your videos, and the type of content you want to produce. You should also decide on a consistent posting schedule and plan out yourcontent calendarin advance to ensure that you have a steady stream of material to share with your viewers.
#2 Invest in Decent Video, Audio, and Lighting Equipment
While you don’t need the most expensive equipment to start a YouTube channel (and you certainly shouldn’t invest before deciding it’s the right thing for you),  it’s important to consider decent-quality gear that will produce fairly high-quality videos. A good camera, microphone, and lighting setup will make a big difference in the final product.
#3 Learn Basic Video Editing
Even if you don’t have a lot of experience with video editing, it’s important to learn the basics. Simple software like iMovie or Adobe Premiere Elements can help you create professional-looking videos with minimal effort.
#4 Engage With Your Growing Audience
YouTube success is all about engaging with your audience and building your community. Building a relationship with your viewers and potential subscribers is essential to success, so respond to comments and questions, ask for feedback, and engage with your audience through live streams and other interactive content. This will help you build a community of loyal followers who are more likely to watch and share your videos.
#5 Monetize Your YouTube Videos
As soon as you hit1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time, enable monetization on your channel and link it to an AdSense account. You can also monetize your content throughsponsorships, paid promotions, or merchandise sales.
#6 Understand and Abide by YouTube’s Guidelines
It’s important to familiarize yourself with YouTube’s guidelines and policies to ensure that your content complies with the platform’s rules. This includes guidelines on copyright, community standards, and advertising policies.
#7 Keep Learning From Other YouTube Creators
There are many successful creators on YouTube who are willing to share their experiences and advice with new creators. Look for creators in your niche and subscribe to their channels to get inspiration and insights into what works on the platform. You can also join creator communities and forums (like TubeBuddy’s own Discord Server) to connect with other creators and learn from their experiences.
By following these tips, you can get started on your YouTube journey with confidence. Remember that success on YouTube takes time and effort, and it may take some trial and error to find what works best for your channel. However, with dedication and hard work, you can build a successful YouTube channel and share your passions with a wide audience.
Our mission is to become your best buddy in the creator economy so you can rely on us to help you grow.

3 POWERFUL WAYS to Make Your YouTube Videos 10x BETTER!
You could be just a few uploads away from your channel completely taking off. These three tips won’t only make your videos better, but they’ll help you reach your goals a lot quicker.
What is the number one piece of advice that new YouTube creators are always given? Just be consistent. Post a hundred videos because this is a marathon. Upload, upload, upload. That’s it. It’s easy as that. Just make videos. Okay, so you follow that advice. You work your butt off. You upload video after video after video. You stay consistent for weeks. Maybe even years. And then nothing. What is even going on?
There are right and wrong ways to be consistent on YouTube. You’re not going to really get anywhere by just uploading videos. You post videos, and you get results by doing these three things consistently. Read on or watch our video for more advice:
#1Upload Frequency is Important But Creative Ideas Are More Effective
The first tip is to consistently develop strong ideas. The foundation of any great YouTube video is a strong idea. No matter how good your production value is or how often you post, if your ideas are weak, your video will be too. It’s just the truth.
Once you realize how important ideas are, you want to understand how to get more and better ideas.
The point is it’s not about the intensity of your upload schedule. It’s the intensity of your ideas that matter most, especially when the right idea has the strength to carry your channel farther than dozens of weaker ideas combined. Brainstorming should take time. Sometimes it may take several days or weeks to come up with a single solid idea, but it will be time well spent.
#2 Consistently Sharpen Your Skills
Being a YouTuber takes WAY more than just sitting in front of a camera and talking. It’s a real job. It takes real work and real skills to master and become really good at. If you want to make good videos, you have to learn how to edit, how to film, and how to just be on camera. There is so much that goes behind each video from every creator. And while consistently uploading videos is important, if you’re not consistently leveling up your skills, your videos don’t get better.
Look back on some of the first videos from your favorite creators. I guarantee you, they are probably a little bit rough. The same glow-up is true for so many other creators.
How did they get so good? They challenged themselves to get better, and they improved the skills that they needed to win. Between each upload, there should be time dedicated just to building up yourself, learning new skills, and acquiring what you need so that that next video can be even better than your last.
Luckily, YouTube happens to be the best place to learn how to be a stronger creator.
#3 Actively Respond to Data
The biggest thing you can do to see better results is to consistently and actively check the data available on your content. There’s a lot of information in your YouTube Analytics, and it can be confusing to understand what it all means. But there are four helpful questions you should be asking yourself every time you are in your YouTube dashboard:
By taking the time to ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to quickly look at your analytics, and one, you’ll know where to start, but two, you’ll be able to make adjustments as necessary based on your answers.
If you want to see real results, you need to put in the work and be strategic about it.

A Crazy Useful Hack to Get More YouTube Views
Welcome to Cracking SEO, a series where we’ll share the best strategies forincreasing views, subscribers,and search rank on YouTubeusing little-known SEO tactics.
We’re not just talking about the basics. The truth is most YouTubers have no idea about these tactics because they’re either hidden deep within YouTube Studio or they’re in plain sight but aren’t being used correctly. Let’s change that right now. Read on or watch our video on the best hack for getting more YouTube views:
Millions of people search YouTube every day looking for specific content, how to tie a tie, what’s the best workout for abs, how to pass your driving test etc. Actually, 51% of YouTube users use YouTube videos to learn new things like this. By adding the right search phrases and keywords to your titles and descriptions, your videos are more likely to appear when people search for these terms on YouTube.
How to Get Your Videos to Show Up in Search Results– in ANY Language!
Getting your videos to appear in search results can kickstart your growth on YouTube when you’re just starting out. But let’s take it a step further. How about having the ability to show up in search results everywhere, in any language, and in any country?
This couldn’t be easier if you use the‘Title and Description Translations’feature in YouTube Studio. This tool allows you to create location and search language-specific variations of your titles and descriptions so viewers who search YouTube in languages other than your own can still find your videos. How awesome is that?
Just sign into YouTube Studio. From the left-hand menu, select Subtitles, then select Video.
If you have the freeTubeBuddy browser extensioninstalled, you’ll see the top 10 languages spoken by your channel’s audience. Use this list to decide which languages you should prioritize when translating your video titles and descriptions.
Select Add Language and then click the language you would like to translate to. Under Title & Description, select Add. Now, enter the translated title and description. You can easily pull this from Google Translate or tapTubeBuddy’s Translate button, and it will automatically translate titles and descriptions into as many languages as you like.
Once done, select Publish, and you’re finished.
If your video is a good match for viewers who search YouTube in another language, your video will now show up. Now you’re ranking for the same keywords and phrases in the translated languages as well.
Adding Subtitles to Your YouTube Videos
If your content does include commentary, you need to add subtitles. Luckily, this is easy. On that same page, under Subtitles, click Add. Just select a language, click Add, then click Auto-translate.
This will create subtitles in the selected language based on either the manual ones you provided or the auto-generated ones that YouTube gives you. It’s literally that simple, and it makes your YouTube channel so much better.
The reality is sometimes viewers from around the world seek content that’s just not available in their native language. In fact, while much of today’s video content is only produced in English, 80% of the world does not speak English. So now, if a viewer finds your video in their language, they’ll also be able to understand it.
Plus, YouTube is building a free dubbing feature that uses AI to dub your videos in multiple languages. So adding translations to your titles and descriptions now is future-proofing your content when YouTube makes this available to all channels, and viewers can immediately start finding and listening to your videos in their own language.

A Crazy Useful Hack to Get More YouTube Views
Welcome to Cracking SEO, a series where we’ll share the best strategies forincreasing views, subscribers,and search rank on YouTubeusing little-known SEO tactics.
We’re not just talking about the basics. The truth is most YouTubers have no idea about these tactics because they’re either hidden deep within YouTube Studio or they’re in plain sight but aren’t being used correctly. Let’s change that right now. Read on or watch our video on the best hack for getting more YouTube views:
Millions of people search YouTube every day looking for specific content, how to tie a tie, what’s the best workout for abs, how to pass your driving test etc. Actually, 51% of YouTube users use YouTube videos to learn new things like this. By adding the right search phrases and keywords to your titles and descriptions, your videos are more likely to appear when people search for these terms on YouTube.
How to Get Your Videos to Show Up in Search Results– in ANY Language!
Getting your videos to appear in search results can kickstart your growth on YouTube when you’re just starting out. But let’s take it a step further. How about having the ability to show up in search results everywhere, in any language, and in any country?
This couldn’t be easier if you use the‘Title and Description Translations’feature in YouTube Studio. This tool allows you to create location and search language-specific variations of your titles and descriptions so viewers who search YouTube in languages other than your own can still find your videos. How awesome is that?
Just sign into YouTube Studio. From the left-hand menu, select Subtitles, then select Video.
If you have the freeTubeBuddy browser extensioninstalled, you’ll see the top 10 languages spoken by your channel’s audience. Use this list to decide which languages you should prioritize when translating your video titles and descriptions.
Select Add Language and then click the language you would like to translate to. Under Title & Description, select Add. Now, enter the translated title and description. You can easily pull this from Google Translate or tapTubeBuddy’s Translate button, and it will automatically translate titles and descriptions into as many languages as you like.
Once done, select Publish, and you’re finished.
If your video is a good match for viewers who search YouTube in another language, your video will now show up. Now you’re ranking for the same keywords and phrases in the translated languages as well.
Adding Subtitles to Your YouTube Videos
If your content does include commentary, you need to add subtitles. Luckily, this is easy. On that same page, under Subtitles, click Add. Just select a language, click Add, then click Auto-translate.
This will create subtitles in the selected language based on either the manual ones you provided or the auto-generated ones that YouTube gives you. It’s literally that simple, and it makes your YouTube channel so much better.
The reality is sometimes viewers from around the world seek content that’s just not available in their native language. In fact, while much of today’s video content is only produced in English, 80% of the world does not speak English. So now, if a viewer finds your video in their language, they’ll also be able to understand it.
Plus, YouTube is building a free dubbing feature that uses AI to dub your videos in multiple languages. So adding translations to your titles and descriptions now is future-proofing your content when YouTube makes this available to all channels, and viewers can immediately start finding and listening to your videos in their own language.

4 Habits You Need to Succeed on YouTube (NEW YouTuber Advice)
If you’re just starting out on YouTube or if you’ve been publishing for a while and want a refresh on the basics, these tips are for you.
Read our insights below or take a look at our YouTube video on the subject:
Succeed on YouTube With These Four Habits
Any guesses on how many videos your average YouTube channel with between 1000 and 10,000 subscribers has uploaded?
152
That’s two videos every week for a year and a half. Maybe you’ll hit it big with your first video, but probably not. Engaging content posted consistently is the key. It takes time to figure out your niche. We start a channel with a big idea; then, we figure out what works and what doesn’t, what people watch and what they skip. In other words, your 150th video will probably be very different from your first, but you’ll need to go through the process of creating those first videos to really find your feet in the world of YouTube.
#1 Keep at it: Persistence is KEY
How do you figure out what works? Data. YouTube Analytics is a good place to start; it gives you that next level of data, helping you choose the right keywords and find gaps in the market. TubeBuddy’sChannelytics,Opportunity Finder, and advancedA/B testing functionscan also be a massive help to any creator. We could talk about data for hours, but the main point is to try new things to see how your content is performing. Do more of what works and less of what doesn’t. Simple, right?
#2 Keep Track of Ideas and Inspiration
Inspiration might be what starts a YouTube channel, but it’s not what keeps it going. Keep a bank of ideas you can draw from when inspiration is hard to find. Create a content calendar and decide what you’re going to post and when. Schedule based on what you can realistically record, edit and publish.
#3 Be Strategic About your Content Scheduling
Let’s say you’re doing a tutorials channel. As a subject matter expert, your instinct might be to jump right into an expert level. That’s limiting your audience. Start with the 101 content. Build a foundation. Later, when you get into the expert-level stuff, new subscribers will have a well of content they could dig into which will continue to drive views to your early videos too.
#4 Treat Creating Content Like a Second Job
Real talk; some days, that’s what it feels like. Apparently, 78% of creators burn out, so approach your channel intentionally so you can be in the other 22%. All of the tips we’ve mentioned will help when the going gets tough. In the end, likes, views, and subscribers feel great when they come, but they’re not entirely within our control. Find support by joining a community of fellow creators.TubeBuddy Discordis a great place to start. Keep at it. Learn from your successful and your not so successful content.
And remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. You’ve absolutely got this.

7 Ways to Get 1000 YouTube Subscribers Faster
Do you want to generate 1000 subscribers on YouTube as fast as possible? We have seven top tips to help you! Just read the following insights or watch our inspiring video:
7 Ways to Get 1000 YouTube SubscribersNow
#1 Create evergreen content that attracts new viewers regularly.
Content like this remains relevant and fresh long after it’s been posted. Typically, these are how-to guides, tutorials, or informational videos that have a long shelf life because this type of content will always be in demand. They’re videos that viewers will constantly be searching for in your niche leading to a steady stream of views and new subscribers over time. For example, how to get a six-pack, makeup tips for beginners, the top 10 best strategy games of all time, tips for studying. These types of videos are interesting today, tomorrow, and years from now.
We knew that every year new creators wonder how theYouTube algorithmworks, so we created a video explaining everything creators need to know about the YouTube algorithm. Although we posted that video over six months ago, it still brings us 700 new subscribers every single month. This is the power of creating evergreen content that people will continue to search for and be interested in over time.
#2 Focus on creating videos that generate results.
If you have several videos uploaded to your channel, take a look at their analytics. You’ll notice that some videos perform better than others in certain areas. Some videos might be great for getting views, while others might be better at earning youwatch time, subscribers, or even revenue. Learn what works best for your goals, then create more videos that produce the results that you want.
If reaching 1000 subscribers is your current goal, concentrate on the videos that are driving subscriptions to your channel but really look at the data. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that the videos with the most views will get you the most subscribers because some of your less popular videos might actually be getting you more subscribers than some of your most popular videos. Knowing what each video is good at will help you focus your time and effort on creating videos that help you reach specific goals, like getting 1000 subscribers faster.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#3 Optimize your channel page to attract new subscribers.
For many viewers, the first impression of your channel is your actual channel page.  Unsubscribed viewers often go here after landing on one of your videos to learn what your channel is about and the kind of videos they can expect from you. This information will help them decide whether to subscribe or not.
You might be shocked by how much your channel page impacts your subscriber growth, but just take a look at your analytics for proof. On theTubeBuddy YouTube channel, our channel page has been our top source for new subscribers, probably because after viewers watch one of our videos, they go to our channel page and see what other things we have to offer before making the decision to subscribe.
Our channel page earns more subscribers than our videos do directly. Your own channel page is one of the top sources for new subscribers, so make sure it’s optimized to attract them. Make sure your banner and About section clearly communicate what your channel is about, and use your featured videos and Playlists to showcase the best that your channel has to offer. Do this, and you’ll quickly see the impact it has on getting you 1000 subscribers.
#4 Strengthen existing content rather than starting over.
There is plenty of content on your channel right now that can help you get more subscribers. Take advantage of your existing content rather than immediately creating a new video. You probably already have a video that viewers love on your channel. It may have great retention and positive comments, and overall, people are happy with it. The only problem is people aren’t clicking on it or watching it. That’s because while the content might be good, the click-through rate is weak, meaning that when viewers come across that video, they just aren’t clicking on it because the title and thumbnail aren’t enticing them to do so.
You can solve this by simply creating a better title and thumbnail for that video. If it’s already a well-liked video, the improved click-through rate will lead to more views and, ultimately, more subscribers without having to create a new video.
If you want to get 1000 subscribers fast, you’ve got to be smart. Go back and make sure you’ve done everything to strengthen your existing content before starting over. This is just going to save you a ton of time and get you more results with the content that you already have.
#5 Make subscribing to you more rewarding
Do you know what’s better than just asking people to subscribe? Asking them to subscribe so you can make a special video or do a collaboration that your viewers would love to see?
Using techniques like this can make subscribing to your channel more interesting and enjoyable.
#6 Use the Community tab to attract new subscribers.
The Community tab is available to channels with at least 500 subs, and it’s gradually being rolled out to even more channels with fewer subscribers. So check to see if you have it. The Community tab is just a super easy, simple way to bring in new subscribers to your channel.
Post polls, ask questions, share behind-the-scenes content, and share things that your ideal audience would find interesting because YouTube will show this both to your current subscribers and non-subscribers.
This could be viewers who have never seen your channel before, or it could be longtime viewers who just haven’t subscribed yet. You can see exactly how many subscribers you’re getting from your community posts in YouTube Analytics. So try it and see how effective it is for you.
#7 Be strategic with the timing of your call to action.
Your call to action or CTA is that moment in a video where you ask your subscribers to do something like subscribe to your channel, and the timing of this can either make or break the performance of that call to action.
Many creators make the mistake of asking for the subscription far too early in their video when they’ve just started building up the relationship with the new viewer. We personally have seen better results by waiting until the end of a video after we’ve shown the viewer why they should subscribe to us and what kind of content they can expect.
Viewers who make it close to the end of your video are the ones who are most engaged, most likely to subscribe, and most likely to come back for more. I appreciate the support, and if you want some more tips on how to get 1000 subscribers faster, watch this video next.
If you’re looking to smash the 1000 subscriber milestone, jump on these tips today and watch those numbers grow.

If you want to get 1000 subscribers fast, you’ve got to be smart. Go back and make sure you’ve done everything to strengthen your existing content before starting over. This is just going to save you a ton of time and get you more results with the content that you already have.
#5 Make subscribing to you more rewarding
Do you know what’s better than just asking people to subscribe? Asking them to subscribe so you can make a special video or do a collaboration that your viewers would love to see?
Using techniques like this can make subscribing to your channel more interesting and enjoyable.
#6 Use the Community tab to attract new subscribers.
The Community tab is available to channels with at least 500 subs, and it’s gradually being rolled out to even more channels with fewer subscribers. So check to see if you have it. The Community tab is just a super easy, simple way to bring in new subscribers to your channel.
Post polls, ask questions, share behind-the-scenes content, and share things that your ideal audience would find interesting because YouTube will show this both to your current subscribers and non-subscribers.
This could be viewers who have never seen your channel before, or it could be longtime viewers who just haven’t subscribed yet. You can see exactly how many subscribers you’re getting from your community posts in YouTube Analytics. So try it and see how effective it is for you.
#7 Be strategic with the timing of your call to action.
Your call to action or CTA is that moment in a video where you ask your subscribers to do something like subscribe to your channel, and the timing of this can either make or break the performance of that call to action.
Many creators make the mistake of asking for the subscription far too early in their video when they’ve just started building up the relationship with the new viewer. We personally have seen better results by waiting until the end of a video after we’ve shown the viewer why they should subscribe to us and what kind of content they can expect.
Viewers who make it close to the end of your video are the ones who are most engaged, most likely to subscribe, and most likely to come back for more. I appreciate the support, and if you want some more tips on how to get 1000 subscribers faster, watch this video next.
If you’re looking to smash the 1000 subscriber milestone, jump on these tips today and watch those numbers grow.

25 YouTube Video Ideas That Will BLOW UP Your Channel
Are you short on inspiration for video content ideas? Whatever type of channel you have, we have 25 ideas for you to pick from to get started. Read through our amazing list or watch our video below:
25 Video Ideas That Will BLOW UP Your YouTube Channel
#1 Share your top recommendations for a topic or category.For instance, the five magical apps that changed my life, the top 10 video games you need to play at least once, or seven places you have to visit in Japan. Choose your favorite things from any category, then write a title that will spice it up and make it stand out from the rest.
#2 Teach others how to do something you’re skilled at yourself.This could be baking, playing an instrument, or editing videos. Even something super unique, like solving a Rubik’s Cube or doing a one-handed push-up, can count.
#3 Review a product or service you love or hate.What are your thoughts on the latest iPhone, your gym membership, and a recent software release? Plus, if you’re one of the first to review something that’s gaining in popularity, you’ll attract a lot of viewers. Think about KSI and Logan Paul’s hydration drink or MrBeast’s chocolate bars.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#4 Film yourself trying something new and document the experience.Like a first ride in a driverless car, learning a new language, or eating really strange foods.
#5 Share a day in your life.This video could show off your job, hobby, or something interesting about you. Think about what makes you stand out and what others might find intriguing. Are you a nail tech, athlete, or full-time student? You can be a mom, mailman, or musician. The list goes on. Show a day being in your shoes and let others see what it’s like.
#6 Reaction videos– you’ve all seen these. Pick a movie, TV show, song, product announcement, or just some funny clips. Many creators will package these as try not to laugh challenges or insert something popular for the first time. Believe me; it works for any creator. Look at lawyer reacts, plumber reacts, doctor reacts, vocal coach reacts, kids react. It literally works for every niche.
#7 Share your tips.These could be about saving money, planning a vacation, organizing your closet, or designing your own website. Educate others about something you know a lot about.
#8 Take on a challenge or transformation.This could be a physical transformation like losing weight or gaining muscle, or maybe challenging yourself to try yoga for 30 days, or breaking a bad habit like procrastination.
#9 Make a tutorialabout something creative or helpful, such as a DIY project, hairstyle, furniture makeover, or computer H\hack.
#10 Share an event or trip.Share your current or past experiences from different cities or countries. If you’re local, share a concert, festival, or weekend getaway.
#11 You could always start by introducing yourself on your channel, or it could say channel trailer. Now, these videos don’t get a lot of views when you’re new, but they’re still great for getting to know you and what kind of content to expect from your channel. Plus, they’re really cool to look back on to see how much you have grown.
#12 Unboxings and hauls.This works really well for fashion, beauty, and tech channels but can be applied to other niches like cooking, fitness, and design.
#13 Share a video of your routine.It can be your morning routine, nighttime skincare routine, weekly meal prep, workouts, or anything else you do regularly. Getting a glimpse into someone else’s daily routine inspires viewers to find new ideas and inspiration for their own.
#14 Create a storytime video.Share a personal, funny, embarrassing moment or interesting experience. Humans have been captivated by stories for centuries. We love hearing about other people’s unique experiences. Plus, good stories are highly shareable and watchable without a lot of planning or editing.
#15 Do a comparison or versus video,iPhone versus Android, calisthenics versus weightlifting, budget hotels versus luxury hotels, what college is like in Germany versus the USA.
#16 Share a video that starts with why, followed by a belief, choice, or another topic you feel strongly about. It could look like this. Why I don’t wear makeup, why I started waking up at 5:30 AM, why I became vegan, why I’m leaving New York City. These ideas can be applied to any niche.
#17 Start your video with howI followed by the skill or accomplishment you have. How I learned to speak French fluently. How I saved $10,000 in one year. How I lost 50 pounds. How I got into my dream college. How I video not only share valuable information with your audience but also demonstrates your experience and expertise in your niche.
#18 Make a video about things.Things I learned in my first year of college. Ten things you need to know before playing Modern Warfare II. Five things to do before you sell your car. Thirty-two things I wish I knew before getting braces.
#19 Video essays.Describe your argument, thoughts, research, and opinions on the topic related to your niche. It can be serious and educational or silly and lighthearted. Look at these two essays for inspiration.Why MrBeast is a geniusand why Bohemian Rhapsody is the best song ever written:
#20 Share your favorite resources related to your niche.Think about books, podcasts, apps, websites, tools, etc. Besides providing valuable information for your viewers, it could open up some greataffiliate marketing opportunitiesif you use resources with referral programs. Some cool ones are my favorite photography apps. four writing tools I can’t live without. ten cheap gaming PC accessories you need for your computer desk.
#21 Share a video talking about the biggest failures related to your subject.If you’re a filmmaking channel, share mistakes from movies or TV shows. Fitness channels could share gym mistakes. Entrepreneurs could talk about failed business ventures or mistakes you made starting out.
#22 Create a top five or top ten video list.This could be the top five places to visit, top ten products, or top five ways to save money.
#23 Share a video that discusses misconceptions.With these videos, you can educate and inform your audience about common misunderstandings and inaccuracies in your area of expertise. Misconceptions about mental illness, fashion industry misconceptions, 14 facts you heard growing up, but which are myths.
#24 Talk about the latest news.New cars, science breakthroughs, or fashion trends could all be included here.
#25 Answer frequently asked questions.Videos like this typically rank well in search too, increasing your views and subscribers over time. Some great examples are, how much money do YouTubers make? What should I eat before a workout? What is the best camera for vlogging? How to improve your credit score.
We hope you find these ideas inspiring and kickstart your next batch of content.

#7 Share your tips.These could be about saving money, planning a vacation, organizing your closet, or designing your own website. Educate others about something you know a lot about.
#8 Take on a challenge or transformation.This could be a physical transformation like losing weight or gaining muscle, or maybe challenging yourself to try yoga for 30 days, or breaking a bad habit like procrastination.

#11 You could always start by introducing yourself on your channel, or it could say channel trailer. Now, these videos don’t get a lot of views when you’re new, but they’re still great for getting to know you and what kind of content to expect from your channel. Plus, they’re really cool to look back on to see how much you have grown.
#12 Unboxings and hauls.This works really well for fashion, beauty, and tech channels but can be applied to other niches like cooking, fitness, and design.
#13 Share a video of your routine.It can be your morning routine, nighttime skincare routine, weekly meal prep, workouts, or anything else you do regularly. Getting a glimpse into someone else’s daily routine inspires viewers to find new ideas and inspiration for their own.
#14 Create a storytime video.Share a personal, funny, embarrassing moment or interesting experience. Humans have been captivated by stories for centuries. We love hearing about other people’s unique experiences. Plus, good stories are highly shareable and watchable without a lot of planning or editing.
#15 Do a comparison or versus video,iPhone versus Android, calisthenics versus weightlifting, budget hotels versus luxury hotels, what college is like in Germany versus the USA.
#16 Share a video that starts with why, followed by a belief, choice, or another topic you feel strongly about. It could look like this. Why I don’t wear makeup, why I started waking up at 5:30 AM, why I became vegan, why I’m leaving New York City. These ideas can be applied to any niche.
#17 Start your video with howI followed by the skill or accomplishment you have. How I learned to speak French fluently. How I saved $10,000 in one year. How I lost 50 pounds. How I got into my dream college. How I video not only share valuable information with your audience but also demonstrates your experience and expertise in your niche.
#18 Make a video about things.Things I learned in my first year of college. Ten things you need to know before playing Modern Warfare II. Five things to do before you sell your car. Thirty-two things I wish I knew before getting braces.

Some cool ones are my favorite photography apps. four writing tools I can’t live without. ten cheap gaming PC accessories you need for your computer desk.
#21 Share a video talking about the biggest failures related to your subject.If you’re a filmmaking channel, share mistakes from movies or TV shows. Fitness channels could share gym mistakes. Entrepreneurs could talk about failed business ventures or mistakes you made starting out.
#22 Create a top five or top ten video list.This could be the top five places to visit, top ten products, or top five ways to save money.

10 YouTube Shorts Niches That GET MILLIONS of Views FAST!
Over the last 90 days, we examined over 30 million Shorts videos with a total of 1.3 trillion views to determine the top niches. If you’re trying tocash in on Shorts monetization, get more views, get more subscribers, or just want to know what’s trending in YouTube Shorts, then read on or dive into our video on this red-hot subject:

#1 Entertainment:
Entertainment is by far the most popular Shorts niche, accounting for over 17% of all YouTube Shorts views over the last 90 days. But it’s not just any entertainment content. Viewers are mostly watching pranks, challenges, and a special genre known as “oddly satisfying.”
These types of videos work so well because they’re what I consider global-friendly. They work in any language, although they oftentimes don’t include any speaking at all, making them easily consumed around the world. They are truly a global phenomenon and are therefore racking up a ton of views via YouTube Shorts.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#2 Food and Drink:
The next niche is food. Now, food can include a lot of topics: cooking tutorials, food reviews, mukbangs, etc . but food content centered around chocolate, gummies, and meat-filled recipes are at the top of the charts.
A good example of a creator killing it isalbert_cancook. Albert takes his cooking niche and makes it wildly appealing by recreating popular dishes from restaurants, TV shows, and movies. This short-form food format is the reason why his channel is skyrocketing on YouTube right now. According to Social Blade, his channel’s getting 20,000 subscribers every single day.
#3 Video Games:
The third niche is video games. I know some of you are happy to hear this. The beautiful thing about gaming content is it’s attractive to viewers of all ages. And trend-jacking popular video games or new releases are a great way to drive up views quickly. Because of the general interest in certain games, viewers are already looking for content related to them. So you can just ride the wave of popularity and get more views without having to do a bunch of extra work. In our research, we found that the games that are getting the most views from Shorts are:
#4 Sports:
The fourth niche is sports, specifically fishing, basketball, martial arts, and football. If you think you can make content around them, you probably should
#5 Crafting:
Crafting videos pulled over 16 billion views in the last 90 days. Art and crafting are skills that many people don’t have, so this makes this an attractive niche for skilled artists because of the much lower competition. Not many people can do things like this. And it’s easy to stand out even if you’re starting out if you’re good.
The top categories in this niche were drawing, woodworking, and paper art. But things like sewing and metalwork were popular too. Even videos around pottery got millions of views. And even if you’re not planning to make these crafts, they’re so fun and entertaining to watch because you’re just getting to see the process and how it’s done. That’s why crafting videos are killing it on Shorts right now.
#6 Family and Parenting:
You may be surprised to hear that gender reveal videos can generate over 20 million views each. Yeah, this niche is pretty popular. Marriage and wedding videos pulled in 2.6 billion views combined. Childbirth and pregnancy pulled in another 1.2 billion, and videos around fatherhood pulled in over 710 million.
#7 Animals and Pets:
Who doesn’t love a cute animal video? Footage of your pets doing funny things and reaction videos to animals seem to work best. But we see a lot of skits where pets are the main characters do extremely well.
#8 Movies and Television:
Now, this is another great one for writing trends. Netflix released the show “Wednesday” on November 23rd, 2022. And the channels that make content around the show during its spike in popularity got loads of views. In fact, seven of the top ten videos for TV series in the last 90 days were about “Wednesday.”
The same happens when any popular TV show or movie gets released. And Netflix actually shows you what’s trending in the top 10 movies and shows that people are watching. Use this information to your advantage so you can find out what’s trending at the moment so you can make content.
#9 Science and Technology:
Within this niche, science experiments came in third place, robotics came in second, and at the top of this niche is consumer electronics, mainly smartphones and tablets. And if you’re a tech channel, pro tip here, iPhone-related hacks, pranks, and challenges do the best.
#10 News:
Here’s the thing, short-form content is now a major way that we all consume our news. A recent survey found that 57% of Gen Z get their news from social media instead of traditional sources like TV and newspapers. And that number only goes up when we look at younger demographics. Shorts around current events, politics, and trending news stories are crushing it onYouTube Shorts.
Now if you’re trying to blow up on YouTube Shorts, we have a lot of content planned for you. From interviews with successful Shorts creators to revealing strategies that are driving millions of views. So keep tuned!
Our mission is to become your best buddy in the creator economy so you can rely on us to help you grow.

How Small Channels can Make Big Money on YouTube
Starting a YouTube channel is a fun and potentially lucrative way to share your interests, hobbies, or experiences with a large audience. Although the most popular YouTube channels frequently have millions of subscribers, it is still feasible forsmaller channels to succeed on the platform and earn some revenue.
Here are some pointers for tiny YouTube channels looking to monetize their content and generate income:
#1 Turn on YouTube channel monetization:

How to Find Your Audience on YouTube
If you want to build an engaged subscriber base andearn money from your videos on YouTube, you need to know where to go for your audience. Here are some suggestions for reaching your intended demographic on the platform:
#1Finding an audience on YouTube begins with narrowing in on that audience’s interests. How would you like your videos to progress? Can you describe your ideal viewer? Finding your target demographic and honing in on their interests will help you produce material that will appeal to them and bring in more people.
#2YouTube’s search algorithmheavily considers keywords and tags, so it’s crucial to make use of them. Improve your films’ discoverability by viewers conducting searches for certain terms by using those terms in the video’s title, description, and tags.
#3Sharing your videos with as many people as possible after they have been published is essential. Spread the word about your new videos by posting links to them on your social media profiles, writing about them on your blog, or sending out an email to your mailing list. Targeted advertising on YouTube is another option for spreading the word about your content.
#4Interact with your viewers: Relationship building is key to attracting and keeping YouTube subscribers. Live broadcasts and other forms of interactivity allow you to directly communicate with your audience by way of their comments, questions, and responses. By doing so, you’ll attract a dedicated fan base that will be more likely to view and spread your videos.
#5Dig into the numbers: The YouTube Studio dashboard provides access to a plethora of information about your channel and its audience. You may get a better understanding of your audience and the types of material that they enjoy by looking at this information. Take advantage of these details to strengthen your channel and make more engaging posts. Don’t forget that TubeBuddy makes it easy to take a deep dive into your data too.
#6Join forces with other YouTube creators to expand your exposure to new users. Cross-promotion of one another’s videos is a great way to increase exposure and build an audience. An excellent way to monetize your channel is to work together on sponsored content or product reviews.
By implementing these strategies, you’ll be able to attract a sizable subscriber base to your YouTube channel. It’s important to keep in mind that it will take time and effort to locate and target your audience, but with commitment and hard work, you may create a dedicated and active following on the platform.

How Creators Can Cash in on New YouTube Shorts Monetization
As of right (checks watch) now, YouTube Shorts monetization is here. With this update, creators in theYouTube Partner Programcan get a cut of the revenue for ads played alongside their short videos.
Competing for attention with TikTok, Instagram et. al., YouTube has been pushing hard on short-form video. Shorts monetization is the latest, most impactful YouTube Shorts effort to date.
So how does YouTube Shorts monetization work for YouTube creators? Let’s take a look.
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
YouTube Shorts ad revenue sharing
Direct ad revenue sharing sets YouTube Shorts monetization apart from creator funds and other payment schemes. With this update, YouTube is the only platform that gives creators a well-deserved cut of the action. This simplifies monetization for YouTube Shorts creators and makes getting paid a bit more predictable.
Shorts monetization is available to anyone in the YouTube Partner Program. See the YouTube Partner Program help articleYouTube Partner Program Eligibilityfor the full rundown.
Nothing has changed since we first shared thatYouTube Shorts monetization was coming.
YouTube Shorts monetization requirements
Shorts watch time does not count toward overall channel watch time. That has been frustrating, especially for smaller scale creators on the platform. The monetization update doesn’t change that fact but it does make it easier to accept.
This isn’t the first time creators have been able tomake money with YouTube Shorts. Itisthe first time creators can make money predictably. And regular, long-term, predictable payment is what creators need and deserve.
So, YouTube Shorts monetization is good news for creators. Given that creators are the ones who make the content that brings the audience, it bodes well for YouTube Shorts too.
Making longform videos into Shorts
Before this YouTube Shorts monetization update, the only reason for most long-form creators to consider Shorts was the possibility ofgrowing their channel.
Now, creating shorts from long-form videos to get a cut of that ad revenue just makes sense. But how? How do creators take their long-form videos and translate them into Shorts?
If only a company whose whole purpose is to help YouTube creators succeed had been thinking about this for a while. If only they saw fit to release a new feature to help creators succeed with Shorts.
Maybe it could use AI to highlight the parts of a longform video that got the most engagement. Then perhaps it could take those highlights and make Shorts recommendations and set creators up for Shorts success. Oooh! What if it gave creators timecodes and context that they would then use to either create a cutdown or better yet, a new Short? Then what if (speaking hypothetically here) itreleased in betain a week and in full in like a month?
That’d be pretty cool, right?

#3 Keeping up with platform changes:
Platform policies are continuously changing, and YouTubers should be aware of the rules and make sure that their work conforms with them by keeping up with any changes. This entails being informed of any modifications to the platform’s advertising policy as well as comprehending and abiding bycopyright laws.
#4 Success in the creator economy involves a delicate balancing act between creativity and business acumen:

How to Pick the Right YouTube Channel Name for Creator Success
Choosing the right name for your YouTube channel can be a challenge, but it’s important for making the right impact.
When people come across your content for the first time, they will see your channel name, which has a significant bearing on whether they choose to watch your videos or go on to other content.
Sure, you could use aYouTube channel name generatorto come up with new YouTube channel name ideas but…
The following are some pointers for choosing the ideal YouTube name forsuccess:
Black Friday: 40% off
Upgrade or renew a Pro or Legend annual license to supercharge your channel growth with AI tools, SEO Studio, A/B testing, Thumbnail Analyzer, and more. Use code YEAR40 and get 40% off right now.
#1 Keep Your Channel Name Simple:
Pick a channel name that is simple to spell and easy to remember. Viewers could be less likely to search for your material if the titles are long or difficult to recall.
#2 Make Your Name Memorable:
Try to think of a unique and memorable channel name. By doing this, you’ll be able to stand out from other content producers and make it simpler for users to find your channel.
#3 Think About Your Potential Audience:
Consider your target audience and any potential needs they may have. Think about putting that in your channel name if you’re writing content for a particular audience or subject.
#4: Use Powerful Keywords:
Use keywords in the name of your channel to help people find your content through searches. For instance, if you make cooking videos, your name can contain the words “food,” “cooking,” or “recipe.”
#5 Keep it Unique:
Avoid channel names that are similar to those of other channels.
#6 Don’t Be Afraid to Use Your Own Name:
Consider using your own name if you feel comfortable doing so. By doing this, you may develop your unique brand and make it easier.
#7 Keep Your Channel Name Professional:
Your channel name should not contain any offensive or improper words. This not only looks unprofessional, but it might result in YouTube suspending or removing your channel.
#8 Ask for Feedback on Any Potential Name:
Before settling on a channel name, run it by a few different family members or friends to get their opinion and find out if they like the name.
#9 Be Adaptable:
If your name just isn’t working for you, don’t be scared to modify it. It’s OK to start over with a new name if you’re not getting the traction you want or if you feel that your current channel name no longer fits.
Choosing the right name for your YouTube channel is an important first step in building a presence online. Make it stand out and draw visitors by keeping it short, memorable, and pertinent to your target demographic.

Is the Video Intro the Death Of YouTube Custom Thumbnail?
YouTube has changed a lot over the years. New designs, new creators, new algorithms, and new rules….but we never expected this particular one.
If you open your YouTube app, start scrolling down, and then stop, the custom thumbnail for the video you stop on disappears, and the video automatically starts playing as part of the. Inline Player feature.
This is aimed at teasing the viewer as to the content of your upload, helping give them a taste of your content before they decide to click or skip. For creators, this option is a mix of good and bad and scary. Keep reading for information about the importance of video intros,  or watch our video below:
Why YouTube Custom Thumbnails Have Served Creators So Well
They have always served as the only visual gateway into your content. They were the deciding factor between viewers clicking or passing up on your video.
But now, with the inline player introducing new viewing behaviors, your video thumbnail is becoming obsolete.
Your video intro actually matters a lot more than ever before.Perhaps even more critical than your thumbnail itself. This isn’t just speculation. According to YouTube director Todd Beaupre, intros are becoming increasingly important as the YouTube homepage and search incorporate more inline video previewing versus static thumbnails.
“For many viewers, the video intro is the new thumbnail.”
Those are words directly from the director at YouTube. Tubebuddy confirmed this by asking our community for your feedback. 71% of viewers polled on our channel said that they used these previews in the app to decide if they want to continue watching a creator’s video, which is actually crazy because viewers are not just looking at your title and thumbnail when deciding to watch a video.
Your video intro is a third factor, and YouTube could entirely remove custom thumbnails on the homepage. It’s not that strange when you think about it.
Most platforms have already moved away from thumbnails in the home feed. Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. You don’t see thumbnails in the main mobile feed. Even Netflix has an autoplay feature.
Videos that autoplay also seem to boost engagement and retention. On Facebook, autoplay increased likes, shares, and comments by 25%, according to one report.
Twitter also revealed that brands saw a 700% increase in completions of promoted videos via autoplay, boldly labeling the change as a new standard in viewability.
This could be a win-win for platforms and creators, and we wouldn’t be surprised if YouTube’s planning to downplay thumbnails soon. After all, this whole inline player update we saw this year started as a test in 2017. And in 2018, YouTube was already experimenting with replacing custom thumbnails with auto-generated ones for a small percentage of users.
Amore significant shift away from customized thumbnails in a viewer’s recommendations may not be that far off. For many of you, this might be incredible news. Most of us suck at making thumbnails. And countless videos get held back by poor titles and thumbnails.
What if we didn’t have to worry about our thumbnails limiting the success of our videos at all? What if we could just focus on creating content and let YouTube’s robots do the rest?
But hey, that future is not here yet. You still need to focus onmaking great thumbnails that pop on YouTube.Plus, I don’t see custom thumbnails disappearing in other parts of the platform. End screens,Playlists, and your channel page are substantial traffic sources. And if you minimize a video that you’re currently watching, that whole autoplay thing just stops entirely.
But Remember: Custom Thumbnails Still Matter on Other Parts of YouTube!
So thumbnails are not out the window yet. With this in mind, it’s critically important for you to consider the title, thumbnail, and intro while packaging your videos. Not only to future-proof your content if thumbnails go bye-bye. But to increase your video’s performance today.
Because we also learned in our polls that 41% of viewers will move on from a video entirely if they decide it’s not interesting within the first 10 seconds. Which is even more reason for your intros to be on point.
Your bad intro might be killing your click-through rate!
Previously, your click-through rate was calculated based on how many viewers watched your video after seeing the thumbnail on YouTube. But if nobody sees your thumbnail, what’s considered an impression? And if the video is just always playing, what’s considered a view? Well, direct answers are hard to find, but we did some digging.
YouTube did let creators know that auto-plays from the home page do count as impressions. They also told creators that auto-plays in the home feed will be counted as views when determining the click-through rate.
But when is an autoplay impression counted as a view since the video is always playing? Now they aren’t telling us that much. But based on some testing, I think we can make an educated guess. It looks like the video shifts from an impression to a view after holding the viewer’s attention for10 seconds.
As we said, 41% of viewers in our poll said that they will move on from a video within 10 seconds if it does not capture their attention. In this inline player, because you know the viewer really never committed to the video, just makes it too easy for them to keep scrolling.
Meaning that if your intros don’t hook the viewer, that impression may never move on to a full view. And a lot of impressions plus a few views equals the saddest little click-through rate.
So we repeat, your video title, thumbnail, and intro are essential not only for your video success today but in the future. If your content is underperforming because of a poor title or thumbnail, you can switch that sucker out as much as you’d like. But if the intro is causing people to lose interest, that’s a little tougher to fix. While a better title or thumbnail will help, it won’t solve the problem completely.
Start to pivot now to focus on the equal importance of your video intro, knowing it’s already playing a huge part in what’s being served up to potential viewers and subscribers on YouTube.

What Equipment do You Need to Create Your First YouTube Video?
In the art of creating content, there are a few essential pieces of equipment you’ll need to make your first YouTube video. Some of the most important things you’ll need are:
#1:A camera-equipped gadget (like a smartphone), Internet connectivity, and video editing software in order to make and post a YouTube video. These days, the majority of smartphones and PCs come equipped with cameras and editing software, so you might already have everything you need!
A webcam can be used to record videos if you don’t have a smartphone or computer with a built-in camera. Webcams can be a fantastic alternative if you want to record high-quality video without spending more money on a more costly camera because they are reasonably cheap and simple to operate.

#2:A microphone will be necessary if you wish to enhance the audio in your video. From inexpensive lavalier mics to more pricey shotgun microphones, there are many alternatives available. Your budget and the particular requirements of your film will determine the kind of microphone you use.
#3:Lighting: The quality of your video can be significantly improved by good lighting. You might not need any additional lighting if you’re filming in a room with natural light. However, if you’re shooting at night or in low light, you might want to consider investing in some simple lighting tools like a ring light or softbox lights.
#4:A tripod: Using a tripod can help you maintain camera stability and prevent blurry video. There are various choices, ranging from compact, portable tripods to larger, more robust tripods that can hold heavy cameras.
#5:A video editing kit is required to organize and clip your footage, add transitions, and make any other necessary adjustments after your film has been recorded. Many choices are available that are free or inexpensive, such as Windows Movie Maker or iMovie (for Macs) (for PC). You might wish to spend money on a professional product like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro if you want more sophisticated capabilities and more control over the editing process.
#6:Last but not least, in order to submit and distribute your video on YouTube, you’ll need a YouTube account. It only takes a few minutes and is free to create a YouTube account.
While this list includes the essential tools you’ll need to make your first YouTube video, if your channel expands and you want to raise the caliber of your content, you might want to think about spending money on additional tools and resources. A DSLR camera, additional lighting, and audio gear are a few possibilities to think about. Your budget and the unique requirements of your channel will determine the specific equipment you select.

What Equipment do You Need to Create Your First YouTube Video?
In the art of creating content, there are a few essential pieces of equipment you’ll need to make your first YouTube video. Some of the most important things you’ll need are:
#1:A camera-equipped gadget (like a smartphone), Internet connectivity, and video editing software in order to make and post a YouTube video. These days, the majority of smartphones and PCs come equipped with cameras and editing software, so you might already have everything you need!
A webcam can be used to record videos if you don’t have a smartphone or computer with a built-in camera. Webcams can be a fantastic alternative if you want to record high-quality video without spending more money on a more costly camera because they are reasonably cheap and simple to operate.

#2:A microphone will be necessary if you wish to enhance the audio in your video. From inexpensive lavalier mics to more pricey shotgun microphones, there are many alternatives available. Your budget and the particular requirements of your film will determine the kind of microphone you use.
#3:Lighting: The quality of your video can be significantly improved by good lighting. You might not need any additional lighting if you’re filming in a room with natural light. However, if you’re shooting at night or in low light, you might want to consider investing in some simple lighting tools like a ring light or softbox lights.
#4:A tripod: Using a tripod can help you maintain camera stability and prevent blurry video. There are various choices, ranging from compact, portable tripods to larger, more robust tripods that can hold heavy cameras.
#5:A video editing kit is required to organize and clip your footage, add transitions, and make any other necessary adjustments after your film has been recorded. Many choices are available that are free or inexpensive, such as Windows Movie Maker or iMovie (for Macs) (for PC). You might wish to spend money on a professional product like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro if you want more sophisticated capabilities and more control over the editing process.
#6:Last but not least, in order to submit and distribute your video on YouTube, you’ll need a YouTube account. It only takes a few minutes and is free to create a YouTube account.
While this list includes the essential tools you’ll need to make your first YouTube video, if your channel expands and you want to raise the caliber of your content, you might want to think about spending money on additional tools and resources. A DSLR camera, additional lighting, and audio gear are a few possibilities to think about. Your budget and the unique requirements of your channel will determine the specific equipment you select.

3 Engaging Topics for Your First YouTube ASMR Video
Videos on ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Responses) keep getting a lot of views on YouTube and other social video sites. This content is intended to provide the viewer with a sensory experience, particularly in the spine and scalp. This is frequently referred to as a “brain massage,” and ASMR videos are an incredibly popular kind of soothing and calming entertainment.
They could make a great topic for your debut YouTube video. The following are three excellent topics for your first ASMR upload:
#1 Individualized Roleplaying
Roleplaying for personal attention is one of the most popular ASMR video topics. You pretend to be a masseur, hairdresser, or makeup artist to give the audience a relaxing, private experience. Use soft speech, gentle touch, and different sounds of grooming, like scissors snipping or brush strokes, to create a calm and immersive environment.
This 5-role play ASMR fromDiamondASMRuses different scenarios to soothe the viewer through a series of sensory experiences. To date, it’s generated over 396K views for its creator.
#2 Speaking Quietly or Softly
Soft speech or whispering is another reliable ASMR initiator. In these films, you talk in a soothing, soft voice and frequently make mouth movements and lip smacks that are intended to make the viewer’s scalp tingle. You can talk about anything that interests you, from your hobbies and daily life to your deepest feelings. They even lend themselves well to the counting of vintage jewelry…..
#3 Ambience and Music
Speaking or one-on-one attention aren’t necessary in all ASMR videos. Numerous noises, such as the sound of rain, a fireplace, or a quiet stream, are excellent ASMR triggers for certain people. By recording these sounds and adding a calming visual element, like a peaceful scene or a cozy room, you can create an immersive atmosphere that fans of the genre will love.
When making your first ASMR video, it’s crucial to keep the following in mind, regardless of the topic you select:
Use these tips to make an ASMR video about something interesting or unusual that will keep your viewers interested and even calm them down.

Your audience should be made aware of the requirements and the challenge’s guidelines. Give clear information about the details, such as how long it will last, what materials are needed, and anything else that is important.

This will make your challenge more interactive and interesting, which will help build a sense of community.
6: Enhance your video with great editing.

Beginner’s 5-Minute Guide to Setting up Your Brand New YouTube Channel
So you’ve decided to launch a YouTube channel – congratulations! Whether you want to share your passions, use it as a platform to start a business, or simply have fun creating content, YouTube is an exceptional way to reach a large audience. Ourstep-by-step guide to making a YouTube channel in 2023goes into more detail, but here’s a quick read to getting your brand new YouTube channel up and running:
#1: Choose a memorable and catchy name for your channel:
Because this will be the public face of your channel, choose a name that reflects the content you intend to create. Avoid using long or difficult-to-remember names, and consider including keywords related to your content to make it easier for people to find your channel.
#2: Customize the look and feel of your new YouTube channel:
Including an engaging profile picture, banner image, and channel trailer will help you stand out and make your channel look more professional. Your profile picture should be a clear headshot or logo that represents your brand, and your banner image should be appealing and representative of the content you create. Your channel trailer should be a brief video that explains what your channel is about and why people should subscribe (see more below).
TheLiving Big In A Tiny Housechannel ticks all the boxes when it comes to branding. It has a very unique selling point, which is reflected in its name, and strong, engaging channel art that makes its content clear to anyone who might be interested in subscribing.
#3: Configure the privacy settings for your channel:
You have the option of making your videos private, unlisted, or public. Private videos can be viewed only by you and those you invite; unlisted videos can be shared with a link but will not appear in search results or on your channel page, and public videos can be viewed by anyone and will appear in search results and on your channel page. When choosing which privacy setting to use, think about who your channel is for and what it is for. If you want to build a successful presence on the platform, make your content public.
#4: Make a trailer for your new channel:
As previously stated, your channel trailer is a short video that will be shown to visitors to your channel for the first time. It should be a catchy clip that gives a quick overview of your channel’s content and why people should subscribe. Keep it under two minutes long and include a call to action at the end to encourage viewers to subscribe.
One trailer from Babish Culinary Universe (which used to be called Binging with Babish) is a great example of a short but informative trailer. The channel publishes content that recreates meals from movies and TV shows, and the trailer gives the viewer every reason to subscribe if that’s something that interests them.
#5: Begin creating and publishing content:
The most important thing is to create content about which you are passionate and which your audience will enjoy. Choose a niche in which you are knowledgeable and that has a high potential for growth, and create a content calendar to plan out your videos ahead of time. When it comes to growing an audience on YouTube, consistency is key, so aim to upload new videos on a regular basis.
#6: Promote your new YouTube channel:
Share your videos on social media, write about your channel on your blog, and interact with your audience via comments and live streams. You can build a strong subscriber community if you work with other creators and respond to comments and questions. You can also use YouTube’s promoted video feature to reach a larger audience and get your videos in front of people who might be interested in what you’re saying.
#7: Analyze your results:
YouTube offers a wealth of information about how your videos are performing, such as views, likes, comments, and audience retention. Use this information to figure out what works and doesn’t, and then adjust your strategy accordingly. You can also learn more about YouTube’s creator academy and how to optimize your content for success.
Starting a YouTube channel can be a fun and rewarding experience, but building an audience takes time and effort.

What’s a YouTube Podcast (And Should You Launch One)?
Over the past several years, we’ve witnessed a new wave of TV celebrities and creators launch podcasts. From Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” and Jada Pinkett Smith’s “Red Table Talk,” to Alec Baldwin’s “Here’s the Thing” and Emma Chamberlain’s “Anything Goes,” Hollywood’s biggest stars are coming out of the woodwork to talk about their personal lives, chat with famous guests, and spill the tea on industry gossip.
But of course, you don’t need millions of fans to start a podcast—not everyone can become Jada Pinkett Smith overnight. If you’re already a YouTube creator familiar with the platform, consider launching a podcast channel to drum up additional engagement. YouTube has evencreated a podcast pagefor this very purpose, as more creators have started dabbling in the audio-first medium—likely the first of many new features to support a growing podcaster community online.
Before you dive in, here are some key factors to keep in mind when debuting a YouTube Podcast:
Podcasting is the new social frontier
It feels like it was just yesterday thatSpotify beat Apple Podcastsin listenership. The tables have now turned, with YouTube boasting themost popular podcasting platformin the country: 24.2% of listeners say they use YouTube most, ahead of Spotify (23.8%) and Apple Podcasts (16%).
Overall, the number of monthly U.S. podcast listeners is expected to jump6.1%year-over-year to reach a total of 125 million people in 2022. With the market set todouble in sizeby 2024, the future is bright for America’s burgeoning podcasting industry.
Although radio broadcasting has existed since the early 1900s, and internet radio came on the scene more than 20 years ago, podcasting takes a completely different form than its predecessors. While radio is a one-way street, podcasters can directly engage with their audiences to create interactive communities.
It may be more accurate for us to call it a new type of social media. Instead of posting pictures and receiving likes, you can upload digital recordings to share your hot takes, spark online debates and, ultimately, grow your subscriber base. By attracting followers with personality over trendy editing styles, the medium allows you to be more authentic to yourself and to your subscribers.
Brands want to partner with podcasts
Want to make more money on YouTube? Podcasting might be the answer.
Increasingly, brands are looking to promote their products on podcasts to reach new customers for one simple reason: It works. According to a2021 report, podcast ads are the most recalled ad types, generating more thanfour times better brand recallthan display ads. It’s a known fact that the vast majority of subscribers don’t bother to skip ads either—regular listeners sit through at least80% of each episode, regardless of length.
Podcast content also tends to be more unfiltered, which helps creators foster a stronger connection with their follower base. This means that podcast episodes typically drive more engagement than traditional video uploads—another reason why brands love to partner with podcasts.
Moreover, some creators actually use podcasts as a supplementary source of content for their main channels. TakeLauren Riihimaki. She’s best known for her lifestyle, fashion, and DIY content on YouTube, but she also hosts theWILD ‘TIL 9podcast with her boyfriend, where they discuss more mature topics like relationships and dating advice.
Like Lauren, you can choose to launch a podcast as a secondary channel to offer a more intimate look into your personal life. Podcasts also enable you to explore a niche topic that may be too specific for your main channel. By creating a sub-community of subscribers who are interested in the same content, podcasts can bring people closer together. Brands love to work with creators who have access to this kind of tight-knit community. An engaged follower base is more likely to support a creator’s sponsor; and podcast episodes offer brands the perfect space to promote their products.
Less scripted, more spontaneous
If you’re somewhat experienced as a creator on YouTube, you might assume that podcasting can’t be all that different from what a traditional video upload entails. But nothing could be further from the truth. Sure, you’ll need to record your episode, edit the content to some extent, and add a snappy title to generate views—but the similarities between videos and podcasts end there.
For instance, podcasting involves way less editing. There may be a general outline or script prepared, but to keep listeners engaged, you’ll have to rely on the unexpected twists and turns of spontaneous conversation.
TheBad Friendspodcast, hosted byBobby LeeandAndrew Santino, is a great example of how personality drives audio-first content. The pair often explores a random topic or experience—likegoing to a Korean spa,designing a tombstone, andmarrying a robot—and lets the natural flow of their conversation dictate their content, making their channel all the more unique (and hilarious!).
If you’re serious about launching a podcast, you might want to consider practicing with your co-hosts first to see if there’s a comedic spark. Make sure you give your channel time to grow; and try to stick to a consistent schedule so that your listeners can tune in early. With how fast the podcasting industry is growing, it’s smart to start now and find your footing when you can. Set the bar high and the rest will follow!

For instance, podcasting involves way less editing. There may be a general outline or script prepared, but to keep listeners engaged, you’ll have to rely on the unexpected twists and turns of spontaneous conversation.
TheBad Friendspodcast, hosted byBobby LeeandAndrew Santino, is a great example of how personality drives audio-first content. The pair often explores a random topic or experience—likegoing to a Korean spa,designing a tombstone, andmarrying a robot—and lets the natural flow of their conversation dictate their content, making their channel all the more unique (and hilarious!).
If you’re serious about launching a podcast, you might want to consider practicing with your co-hosts first to see if there’s a comedic spark. Make sure you give your channel time to grow; and try to stick to a consistent schedule so that your listeners can tune in early. With how fast the podcasting industry is growing, it’s smart to start now and find your footing when you can. Set the bar high and the rest will follow!
