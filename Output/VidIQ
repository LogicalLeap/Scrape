Title: Creating Viral YouTube Videos: 10 Tips for Small Channels

Creating Viral YouTube Videos: 10 Tips for Small Channels
Nothing hurts more than spending hours on a YouTube video only to getzeroviews in return. It’s discouraging for any creator, but the sting of failure hits some people harderthan others.Unfortunately, it's the creators running small YouTube channels (and struggling to get noticed) who tend to feel the burn the most.
This raises an important question: How do you go viral on YouTube?
To get the answer, we interviewed three small creators about how they did it and their advice for fellow YouTubers. We spoke withNuHoops, a basketball enthusiast (1.68K subscribers);Esiar, a documentary-style creator (9.8K subscribers); andImJustJR, a Minecraft gamer who's into storytelling (16.6K subscribers).

Collectively, they earned over 1 million views without the luxury of having anything close to a million subscribers. So, in their own words, here's how to make your YouTube videos go viral!
1. Experiment Until You Have a Clear Passion/Expertise
It’s best to have a clear niche lined up for your YouTube channel, but it’s not a big deal if you’re still searching for the right fit. After all, there’s no rush to grow your channel. You can try different things until a topic resonates with you, your audience, and the goals you've set as a creator.
Esiar, who went viral with a few thousand subscribers, explored many ideas before settling on one. He went from gaming videos to YouTube growth advice to documentaries about online personalities. It was his final idea — documenting the rise of famous YouTubers — that birthed the viral video below. It has over500,000 views!
2. Choose a Topic You Know Well or Love Deeply
Whether you stumble upon a topic or develop it over time, one thing is true on YouTube. It's easier to go viral when you understand the ins and outs of what you're posting. The more you know, the faster you grow.
And truthfully, you’ll need plenty of time to brainstorm new ideas and test them on your channel. That’s why creators like NuHoops find it easier to film what they know or showcase hobbies they already enjoy. In his case, covering the NBA was the perfect fit.
3. Figure Out What’s Not Going Viral Yet
Now that you’ve found your niche, the next step is crafting a video that truly stands out. It sounds impossible in theory, but don’t be discouraged by the sheer size of this challenge. Your competitors are a great resource forspotting viral ideas!
Here’s a strategy you’ll find useful:
1. Go to a channel that explores the same topic you’re interested in.
2. Click theVideostab, then selectPopular.
Now, look at the viral videos on this channel. What do they have in common? Better yet, can you make something in the same genre but witha different angle?
Shortly after this realizing this, NuHoops made a video about arm sleeves (below) and went insanely viral with over300,000 views!
4. Choose a Topic Within a Topic
And that brings us to our next tip: Steer clear of YouTube videos that are “too general” or aimed at a broad swath of viewers. That creates an unfair level of competition, especially for a small channel looking for big opportunities. But, one workaround is to find a topic within a topic.
In NuHoop’s case, he created two levels of separation within his content. He covered sports, but not just any sport: Basketball was his focus. And he didn’t limit himself to the competitive aspect of the game, either. He narrowed his vision again to discover the world of basketballaccessories.
So, if you're wondering how to make a YouTube video go viral, start with a popular topic, identify its viral videos, then expose something people are overlooking in the conversation.
5. Don’t Just Film an Idea — Tell a Gripping Story
It’s easy to believe that most videos go viral because the creator decided to chase the perfect idea. There’s some truth to the concept, but it’s missing a vital ingredient, and that’sstorytelling. A viral video is just a popular concept that was turned into a story! It has emotion, conflict, and a sweet resolution that leaves viewers feeling inspired.
ImJustJR took this advice to heart. He filmed a 20-minute story aboutone itemplayers can use in Minecraft, and the video attracted over600,000 views.
6. Create a Thumbnail Anyone Can Understand in Seconds
Did you know that visitors can assess a website’s visual appeal within50 milliseconds? That happens in the blink of an eye! Now, imagine how quickly they'll judge something simple, likea YouTube thumbnail. These quick perceptions are why you need an uncluttered yet appealing image for your video.
After all, it sets off a bad chain reaction when people can't find a reason to click. They avoid the video, which ruins any chance of it being watched, shared, or even going viral.
7. Gain Viewers’ Trust in the First 30 Seconds
Getting your first viral video is about more than collecting millions of clicks. Once a person is on the watch page, you have to convince them to stay there! A study posted by Harvard Business Review says thatrapid sharing of a videois what makes it go viral; and viewers must watch enough of a video to be moved toward that action.
So, how do you gain viewers' trust on YouTube? You can start by:
8. Get Feedback in Real Time
One piece of advice that’s always floating around is to “keep making videos because you'll slowly get better at it." But how helpful is it to pump out content without knowinghowto get better?Or the mistakes you’re making on YouTube?
It’s great to read your viewers’ opinions in the comment section. But Esiar says you have to go deeper to hearspecific advice.
9. Know the Real Definition of Consistency
After going viral, ImJustJR says it’s better to make great videos infrequently instead of pumping out lukewarm content. This contradicts a long-held belief that the key to YouTube success is tonever stop posting.
So, try to make outstanding videos as often as possible. That could look like posting one video a week instead of 20 videos a month!
10. Remember, Failing Is Part of the Journey
While some peopledoget lucky, creating a viral video doesn’t happen overnight. Most people work hard to research topics, understand their audience, and sharpen their storytelling skills until something,anything, trends in the right direction.
Be patient. Be persistent. And most importantly, don’t give up!

Title: 40 Awesome YouTube Channel Ideas (Without Showing Your Face)

40 Awesome YouTube Channel Ideas (Without Showing Your Face)
Can you make a YouTube channel without showing your face?
In 2023, the answer is yes — 100%.
But we'll be honest: Starting a faceless YouTube channel is no easier than starting one where everybody knows your name. To make up for the lack of face time, you'll need more visual elements, such as stock videos, images, graphics, and text. So in the long run, you'll spend more time editing than other creators.

But making faceless content comes with many advantages, such as:
Ready to get started? Here are the best faceless YouTube channel ideas.
1. Study With Me Sessions
Are you in college or high school? If so, this may be the perfect idea for your YouTube channel. "Study With Me" videos create a virtual library atmosphere, where high levels of productivity meet unwavering concentration. So, crack open your textbooks, point the camera away from yourself, and get to studying! And if you need some inspiration, check outMerve'schannel.
2. Interesting Facts
Have you ever wondered why flamingos are pink or how many times a bee flaps its wings per second? Chances are, someone else is thinking the exact same thing. Well, this is your sign to create a channel dedicated to interesting facts! They'll be the star of the show while you remain 100% anonymous.Bright Sideis a good example, as the channel is faceless but has thousands of facts to share.
3. Quizzes and Games
Who says you can't create your own game show on YouTube? If your friends call you the trivia king or queen, put your knowledge to the test by creating games and quizzes in video format. These channels throw down the gauntlet on topics from pop culture to physics, and you won't see the quizmaster — just the challenge they've set. By the way,Quiz Kingdomis a great example to follow!
4. Magic Tricks and Illusions
You might not have the face of a magician, but then again, you don't exactly need one. Plenty of YouTubers are performing magic tricks with just their hands showing, and you can follow their lead to grow your YouTube channel. Check out this card illusion fromMLT Magic Tricks.
5. Gardening and Plant Care
Imagine starting a plant care channel using your backyard, patio, or the space beside your kitchen window. You wouldn't have to show your face, especially when filming educational videos. For example,The Green Earthhas a viral video exposing indoor plants that grow injust water(no soil required). It's greenery galore without a gardener in sight!
6. Silent Vlogs (Day in the Life Without Talking)
If silence is golden, then silent vlogs are pure treasure on YouTube. These videos strip away the chatter, letting the visuals do all the talking. It's life, unscripted and unspoken, and sometimes that says more than words ever could. For a little inspiration, check outthisisMy's.
7. Puppet Shows and Performances
With this channel idea, puppets have the full stage. If you're crafty and creative, this type of content is a great way to grow on YouTube while staying out of the spotlight. There aren't many puppet channels on YouTube, either, so you won't face overwhelming competition. Check outnanalan' officialto see how it's done!
8. Remote Control Vehicles and Competitions
This YouTube idea offers the thrill of racing without having to drive (or crash) a real car. It's all about the machines and their maneuvers, so you can definitely show that without appearing on camera. For example,Manish Kingdomis one channel cashing in on this easy idea!
9. Pet Vlogs
Who's really the boss at home? Pet vlogs are a great way to showcase the daily drama and delights of our animal overlords. After all, it's a pet's world — we're just living in it (and filming it). There's no better example of this thanZeusy The Talking Pitty.
10. Wildlife Watching
If you a wildlife enthusiast, you're fortunate in that you'llneverhave to appear on camera. You can go bird watching, whale watching, or any type of watching for that matter — and let the animals steal the show. Check outDolphinDroneDomto see how majestic this channel idea can be!
11. Travel Guides
You don't have to go to Europe, Asia, Africa, or any other continent to show the world around you. Plenty of faceless channels are using stock footage and imagery to show the most exciting cities on Earth! Best of all, these videos get massive buzz.Touropiasnagged 8.7 millions views with their viral guide, "25 Most Beautiful Destinations in Europe."
12. Book Summaries
Do you love reading books? Have you always believed that animated videos are thecoolest? If so, it's time to start your faceless channel and make "book summaries" the sole focus! Many people don't have time to read a full book, so you'll help them out by summarizing the main takeaways. That's howEscaping Ordinarygot 14 million views with a summary ofAtomic Habitsby James Clear.
13. Science Experiments
A science experiment is the perfect activity for starting a faceless YouTube channel. After all, people come to see a shocking treat, and not necessarily the creator performing them. So, no worries here: You can keep the camera on your hands and rake in millions of YouTube views. Check out this video byFun Science, which got 26 million views showing a compilation of experiments!
14. Animated Storytimes
Telling a personal story is one of the best ways to connect with viewers around the world. And, you don't have to be on camera to do it! Many creators take the comic book or cartoon approach, sketching out their story so it's visually compelling.Swoozieis the king of animated storytimes, and he pulls in millions of views with each upload!
15. Tech Reviews
Tech reviews are popular on YouTube, but it's also an oversaturated niche with lots of competition. And guess what? Most techies on YouTube show their face. But you can stand out by focusing on the product you're reviewing and having sharp, insightful narration! If you need inspiration, check outFlossy Carter.
16. Puzzle Solutions
Some people are solving the hardest puzzles on Earth withoutevershowing their faces.Puzzle Guyis one of those fascinating creators. This channel has over a billion views, so don't underestimate the joy of solving a good puzzle!
17. DIY Crafts
Some channels have no facesorhuman dialogue, likeKuti Bari. This DIY creator (do it yourself) shows viewers how to craft cool things without necessarilyexplaininghow to do it. Nonetheless, people still love the content! Check out the video below, which earned 5.3 million views for turning a Coke bottle into a table lamp!
18. Finance and Investing Tips
If you understand money on an academic level, try explaining it to millions of viewers on a faceless channel! Finance has been popular on YouTube for years, so why not snag some of those views for yourself? Creators likeThe Swedish Investorare practically going viral with each video. The one below explains the psychology of money, and it has 3.5 million views!
19. Virtual Dog TV (Relaxing)
Do dogs watch TV? Some creators are proving that they do. Several YouTube channels are producing TV shows for dogs, which includes scenic nature, animals grazing, other dogs playing, and calming music. With this type of channel, you can go faceless for as long as you wish;Relax My Dogsurely has!
20. Satisfying Cleaning
Cleaning videos are popular on YouTube, especially the satisfying ones. So break out the heavy cleaning agents, scrubbers, and rubber gloves because this channel idea is 100% faceless!
21. Scary Stories/True Crime
Is Halloween your favorite time of the year? Do you live for mysteries, suspense, and jump scares in movies?
Maybe it's time to start a horror channel on YouTube. Your videos don't have to be bone-chillingly scary, but a healthy dose of suspense will bring viewers to your channel.
And if you want to flex your creativity, horror content is the perfect playground. Some channels mix animation, true crime, and narration to tell the creepiest, most entertaining stories on YouTube.
Here's one example fromIMR Scary Tales: "3 True McDonald's Horror Stories Animated."
22. Top 10 Ranking Videos
Do you like to research any and everything in your free time? If so, that's a skill you can quickly bring to YouTube. Depending on what you're interested in, you could spend your days ranking the top 10 movies, vacation spots, pizza restaurants, and more. But instead of showing your face, you'll fill in the visual gaps with images, graphics, and voice-over.
And course, we have a great example. Check out this video fromHelloGreedorankingStar Warsmovies from worst to best.
23. Poetry and Spoken Word
Many poets recite their work on-stage in front of a live audience. But with the freedom YouTube provides, there are plenty of ways to share the same performance without ever showing your face.
For example, take a look atRedFrost Motivation. This channel re-enacts popular poems using dramatic B-roll, captions, and voice-over. You can't see the speaker or their body language, but the emotions are just as real on this channel. Here's their rendition of Robert Frost's poem,Acquainted with the Night.
24. Documentary
Making documentaries is one of the easiest ways to avoid showing your face on YouTube. Instead of focusing on yourself, you'll hold a lens to everything else happening in the world. What's going on with climate change? Why do Americans travel to only a few states? Will physical money disappear one day?
One such example isFuture Unity. Armed with B-roll and voice-over, this channel tackles big questions without ever showing the creator's face. The content is based on both facts and rumors, which shows just how far you can take a documentary-style approach.
25. Movie and TV Reviews
If you consider yourself a movie critic, we have great news for you.
It's true. Channels likeSteve Reviewshave over 500,000 subscribers, and they don't reveal themselves at all. Instead, they share unique commentary and movie clips to keep things interesting.
Want an example? Watch this video where Steve Reviews reacts to viewers not likingThe Super Mario Bros Movie.
26. Early Childhood Education
"Made for kids" content is popular on YouTube becauseanyone can do it without being on camera. You can teach toddlers how to sing their ABCs, recognize shapes, count to 10, and much more. You'll charm kids and their parents with fun animations and up-beat music — not your face!
If you need an example, watch this counting video fromThe Singing Walrus.
27. Cooking (with Only Hands Showing)
There's been a rise in faceless cooking channels in the past few years. Instead of telling viewers how to cook something, these peaceful creators opt toshowthem instead.
Our best example comes fromNino's Home, an ASMR cooking channel that adds recipe instructions in the caption area. Check out this video where they quietly sizzle fried chicken.
28. Stock Footage and B-Roll
Who doesn't love drone footage of a rolling countryside or a sprawling cityscape? If you're good with aerial cameras, this might be the faceless YouTube niche for you!
It may come as a shock, but stock footage channels are getting decent views. In fact, this video of Los Angeles from21Aerials Stock Video Footagehas over 100,000 views.
29. Sports Analysis
"Sports talk" usually happens under studio lights at a camera-centric network, such as ESPN. But you don't have to follow the same path on YouTube. Anything's possible with a little B-roll and voice-over, so don't think you have to dress up like analyst Shannon Sharpe on SportsCenter.
When it comes to sports analysis,Total Running Productionsis one of the best channels to learn from. This creator makes videos about fast times and world records withoutevershowing their face.
Check out this video where they break down one of the fastest top-end speeds ever recorded.
30. Nursery Rhymes
Nursery rhymes are all the rage on YouTube, and that's not changing anytime soon. If you have a lovely singing voice (and maybe a friend that's good at animation), you can definitely launch a faceless YouTube channel for baby songs.
Cocomelonis the standout channel in this niche. Watch their most popular video about taking a bath.
31. ASMR
ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response. That's a fancy way of describing the tingling sensation on your scalp when you hear soothing sounds. And yes, entire YouTube channels are dedicated to that joyous feeling.
Some ASMR channels soothe viewers with gentle whispers. Others mimic familiar sounds we find relaxing: raindrops, rustling trees, pages turning in a book. It's an auditory experience, so no one's expecting to see your face — much like this waterfall video fromRelaxing White Noise.
32. Product Unboxings
Unboxing videos aresuperchill, and they typically don't come with a product review. Instead, the creator opens the product's packaging for the first time to reveal what's inside — sometimes without saying a word.
For example, check out the iPhone unboxing video below (it's ASMR).
For both video types,the product is the star of the show. That means you can test the latest iPhone or unbox a waffle iron without people needing to know who you are. You'll show your hands holding the product more than anything else.
33. Time-Lapse
Have you ever watched a video where the morning sky turns to night in mere seconds? What you witnessed at that moment was a time-lapse. You saw the scene move impossibly fast, but in reality, many images appeared in rapid succession to create the illusion of warped time.
Here's a fun example where a colony of ants spend41 dayseating half a marshmallow.
But that's just one way to get the job done. These days, you can make time-lapse videos on an iPhone or with different Android mobile apps — all without showing your face.
34. Guided Meditation
Meditating alone is difficult for some people. That's why beginners seek guided meditations on YouTube, especially those led by soft-toned instructors.
Does that sound like something you could do? The good news is that starting a meditation channel is less competitive than starting one about gaming or music. If you have a relaxing voice and thoughtful instruction, we'd say you have a fighting chance!
Here's one example from theGreat Meditationchannel.
35. General Animation/Illustration
Becoming a faceless YouTuber is easy if you have animation skills. You can make 2D, 3D, or stop motion videos without ever appearing on-screen.
For example, take a look at this video from3D artist Jake Fellman. He often uses trending topics in pop culture (in this case, the video gameAmong Us) to make animated videos for billions of viewers.
You can also createwhiteboard animationson YouTube. For this type of video, viewers see a collection of hand-drawn images (on a digital whiteboard) that combine to tell one story — and viewers love it.
But if you aren't the best artist, you can use a service likeVideoScribeto bring your whiteboard animations to life.
36. Reaction Videos (Audio Only)
We're sure you've seen videos where someone reacts to a trending event on-camera, gasping at the "wow" moments and laughing at the "oops" ones. If that's not your speed, don't worry; there are other ways to make reaction videos on YouTube.
If you don't want to show your face, you can do aspeaking reactioninstead. Start by screen recording the original video, then share your opinion via voice-over as you watch the video.
37. Gaming
Of all the faceless content out there, the stuff we've seen on gaming channels is some of the best.
The focus of a gaming video isneverthe person playing the game, so it's easy to make content without revealing your identity. All you have to do is screen record your gameplay, add some voice-over, then bam — it's a YouTube video. You can make gaming tutorials, build a compilation of your fails/wins, or walk viewers through different missions.
Need an example? Watch this hilarious video fromLet's Game It Outabout the video gameWorldBox.
38. Relaxing Music
This one's for all the musicians out there. If you make relaxing music, such as ambient or lo-fi, viewers are practically waiting for you to make a YouTube channel. Life gets busy, and we all need music for quiet moments, like hiking, studying, and meditating.
Lofi Girl(formerly Chilled Cow) has been that musical source for years. Check out their continuous stream of relaxing music below. No faces, of course!
39. Explainer/Commentary/Motivational Videos
Guess what? You don't have to turn on the camera to share your point of view. If you're willing to use other elements in your video – voice-over, graphics, stock footage — you can do impressive things on YouTube.
That's howAlux.commakes videos, and they've got more than 4 million subscribers. We've never seen a face on their channel, but a female narrator talks about wealth and finance in each video.
For example, check out the video, "100 Words Rich People Use."
40. Tutorials
If you have a useful skill, why not start a faceless how-to channel? There are countless ideas to try, but you might enjoy some of these:
Remember, these are broad ideas forstarting a YouTube channel. You'll probably have to mold them into something that feels more like "you" and the content you're planning.
But automating your YouTube channel is one way to make the journey smooth. Here's how!

How to Monetize a YouTube Podcast: Brand Deals and Sponsorships
When you think of making big money on YouTube, podcasts probably don't come to mind — especially now that many creators are starting their own shows.
But with the way things are going,why wouldn’t they?The format allows any and every niche to have its own space, and that's rare!
The hard part, however, is building up consistent views if you’re just starting out. After all, that’s the best way tomake a living from YouTube ads.

But what if there wasa better wayto monetize your podcast, and not just rely on advertising revenue?
Read More:Everything You Need to Know About Starting a YouTube Podcast
For example, have you noticed that some podcast hosts are reading advertisements aloud instead of sticking to YouTube's automated ones? Sometimes these ads come from small local businesses that aren't using Google ads to get noticed. They get more business bypaying influencersto talk about their products and services, and these agreements are called brand deals (or sponsorships).So, how can you hop on the sponsorship wave? Keep reading to learn all about it, and earn a living from your YouTube podcast!
Understand the Basics: The Sponsor's Wishlist
According to this article, 62% of U.S. consumers listen to podcasts, and that number has risen over the last 8 years. But sponsors aren't looking to advertise to just anyone. They want to support podcasts that reach their customers and have thousands of engaged listeners. So, certain markers of success will give you the edge when it comes to landing sponsorships for your podcast. Here's what brands are looking for.
1. The Right Audience for Their Product
The specifics of who is listening to a podcast — age brackets, geographical locations, and overall interests — can help sponsors determine if your audience mirrors their target market.
Now, we know what you’re thinking:How can I meet these requirements if I'm just starting out?And, we hear ya! But it's important to create a podcast you're passionate about and let the sponsors decide ifyou'rethe right fit. After all, you can't change the basis of your show every week to try and land a deal from every brand. Stick to one niche and partner with companies in that industry.
2. Lots of Unique Listeners
Sponsors are on the lookout for channels with a healthy subscriber base and plenty of listeners/viewers. After all, they're investing in your reach and betting on your ability to amplify their message. So, more than anything, you'll want to choose a topic that:
3. High Listener Engagement
It's easy to get swept up in listens and views, but engagement is more important than either of those metrics. Just think about it: If a brand is looking for sales (and not just exposure), it has to target communities that aremotivated to buy.So, a podcast channel with a lively comment section, a flurry of likes, and thousands of shares will catch their attention!
4. Lengthy Audience Retention
On YouTube,audience retentionrefers to how long viewers (or listeners) consume a video on average. And it's a big deal to podcast sponsors. If an episode is 60 minutes long, but an advertisement appears at the 20-minute mark, that means listeners have to consume 33% of the show to even realize a brand was mentioned. This means the show itself has to be engaging, especially if you want to land more brand deals.
Building a Media Kit: Your Track Record of Triumphs
On YouTube, your past successes are the best predictor of future triumphs. So, build a media kit that proves you can create value for sponsors!
Read More:How to Make a Stunning Influencer Media Kit for Brand Deals
A media kit is simply a document that details everything we mentioned above: the audience demographics of your podcast and important details about your listenership.
Finding Brands to Add to Your Media Kit
Begin with smaller, local businesses or brands that resonate with your content's theme. These initial partnerships are stepping stones, providing you with the experience and credibility to attract larger, more lucrative sponsorships. Document each collaboration's success, highlighting how you've met or exceeded the sponsor's expectations. This portfolio becomes your testament to future sponsors, showcasing your ability to deliver results and drive engagement.
How Your Media Kit Should Look and Feel
Your media kit should be a polished, comprehensive document that captures the essence of your channel. It's not just about flaunting your subscriber count or channel views; it's about telling the story of who you are as a creator, the journey of your channel, and the community you've built. It should detail your audience demographics, engagement rates, and any past sponsorships or collaborations.
Pricing and Packages
Sponsors will scrutinize any partnership they're getting into, so be upfront with your pricing. Sponsors appreciate transparency and the ability to choose from different packages that suit their needs.
When you outline your sponsorship packages, clarity is key. You're not just selling ad space; you're offering a partnership that can include a range of options, from on-air shoutouts and product placements to dedicated sponsored episodes. Each package should be designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for customization based on the sponsor's needs and budget.
Where to Find YouTube Sponsors?
The search for sponsors is a proactive mission, and networking is crucial. Industry events, webinars, and even casual social gatherings can open doors to potential sponsorships. Social media platforms, particularly LinkedIn, are invaluable tools for connecting with brand managers and marketing executives.
Podcast directories also offer a treasure trove of potential sponsors, especially those actively seeking to invest in niche content that aligns with their brand.

Pitching to Sponsors: The Art of the Deal
Personalize each pitch to reflect how your channel aligns with the sponsor's brand and goals. Articulate your value proposition with clarity, focusing on how sponsoring your podcast will benefit them. And remember, the follow-up is just as important as the initial pitch. It demonstrates your commitment and can often be the nudge a potential sponsor needs to make the decision.

Legal Aspects
If you decide to partner with a brand, the contract should outline all terms, deliverables, and payment details, ensuring both you and the sponsor are on the same page. It's not just about protection; it's about establishing a professional relationship built on mutual understanding and respect.
Never underestimate the power of a well-drafted legal document. It's the blueprint for a successful partnership!
The Road to Sponsorship Glory
By 2027, the podcast advertising market is projected to have $5.03 billion in revenue, with an estimated 616.5 million users.So, if you want to be a part of it, now is the time to hop on the bandwagon!
Remember, your podcast has the potential to be more than just a passion project; it can be a profitable enterprise that captivates sponsors. So, gear up, get out there, and start forging partnerships that will elevate your channel to new heights.
And here are 8 podcasts that will take your channel there!

Title: 10 Types of Videos that Attract More YouTube Watch Time

10 Types of Videos that Attract More YouTube Watch Time
Even as a small creator, there's a good chance you've seen all the tips and tricks forearning more watch time on YouTube. So today, we're sharing a different perspective. Instead of telling you how to build watch more hours, we're going to reveal the types of videos that get watchedlonger.
Why does this matter? We know most creators want to reach 3,000-4,000 hours of watch time on their channels. Achieving this milestone puts you in the running to join theYouTube Partner Programand make money from your content. After all, who doesn't want some extra cash on the side?
These 10, highly-watched videos will help you do just that!

1. Podcast Episodes
Podcasts are the unsung heroes of YouTube. They're mostly listened to rather than viewed, which means you don't have to worry about keeping viewers' attentionvisually. If the topic is interesting and the conversation flows, podcasting is a powerful way to rack up those watch time minutes.
Plus, YouTube is the number one place to listen to podcasts, according to aLuminate surveyof 3,000 U.S. listeners. The same report lists true crime, comedy, news, and politics as the top genres. Perhaps that's why theJoe Rogan Experience,a leading show, has been popular for so long; it explores a mix of topics and interests!
2. Children's Content
Kids can't get enough of YouTube, and they're known for watching videos on repeat. Whether it's nursery rhymes or educational content, children's videos are a goldmine for collecting YouTube watch hours.
Need an example of just how dominant a kids channel can be? Look no further the viral song, "Baby Shark" by Pinkfong. It's the most-watched video in YouTube history, and it's the first video to hit10 billion views. That's a lot of watch time!
3. "How-To" Guides and Tutorials
"How-to" videos aim to guide viewers through a process, so they can potentially gain higher watch time on YouTube.
But many minutes and hours can one expect in the education space? That depends on what you're teaching andhow complex it is.
For example, a how-to guide on making friends is useful, but whether you need avideofor that is debatable. Technically, you could read a short article and get all the information you need.
Fixing a car engine is more complex and time consuming. That might require a visual guide, written instructions,andaudio cues to make the task a bit easier. So, starting a how-to channel is smart if you're teaching something few people understand!
4. Comedy Skits
YouTube pranks, parodies, and goofy skits have a lot going for themselves. They keep viewers engaged and watching until the end, which is the best way to stack more watch hours. Plus, comedic videos are relatable enough to get shared across internet and evengo viral. This is especially true if the punchline is worth the wait and there's a storyline to follow.
And besides, who doesn't love a good laugh? Google lists comedy as one of thetop four categories watchedalongside music videos, how-to content, and pop culture. Check outGen-Z Hospital, a skit fromSaturday Night Live,to see what people love about this genre.
5. Music Meme Videos
Music videos (or even audio tracks) collect a lot of watch time on YouTube, especially if they're catchy. Just think of all the "internet songs" inspired by viral memes. Some are still gettingthousands of playstoday and building extra watch time by the minute!
For example, have you listened to the meme-ified songIt's Corn!by Songify This, Tariq, and Recess Therapy? The YouTube video has 34 million views and counting, which is impressive for just one year of viewership. The trend may die, but the song lives on forever!
So, here's the real question: Are you musically inclined? Use your talents to songify a meme, and you might get more watch time!
6. Long-Form Documentaries
Documentaries explore one topic topic in depth through a mix of education, entertainment, and sometimesshock value.So, don't think of them as long, boring YouTube videos. If there's some controversy or tension driving the story forward, you have the perfect recipe for keeping viewers' attention.
Need some inspiration? Check outThe Genius Within: Extraordinary Gifted Peopleby Real Stories.
7. Livestreams
Live content allows for real-time interaction between creators and their viewers. These broadcastsaren'tshort, either; many streams will range from a few minutes to12 hours maximumon YouTube. Considering that, it's no wonder streaming pulls in so much watch time!Not only that, it's easy to convert livestreams to regular YouTube content when the broadcast is over. So you'll gain watch hours during the livestreamand after!
One example is the rise of Fortnite livestreams. They're popular, engaging, and lengthy, all of which leads to more viewing minutes.
8. ASMR Videos
ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response. It refers to the tingling sensation running from scalp to spine that a listener feels in response to soothing noises.
But are thererealASMR videos on YouTube? We'll never know for sure. What wedo knowis that videos with great audio get tons of watch time on YouTube.
Like podcasts, viewers don't have to see the screen to enjoy ASMR. It's an auditory experience, so they're listening to rain sounds, gentle wind, cooking noises, and more. Check out this ASMR cooking video from Men With The Pot to see what we mean!
9. Gaming Videos
Gaming is fun, but it's alsotask oriented.Viewers are there to see someone beat a tricky level, build something complicated, explore glitches in a game, and countless other quests. They're learning something new while also being entertained, and that's a sure-fire way to get anyone's attention!

11 Ways to Write Exciting YouTube Titles for Your Videos
Writing good YouTube titles is a tricky task. Just when you think you have the right one, you wonder,Is this appealing enough?Will the title resonate with viewers and make them click?
How to Title YouTube Videos for More Views
Good news incoming: You don’t have to struggle with YouTube video titles anymore. Instead of rewriting to no end, focus on what makes a good headline:
1. Use Words Your Audience Can Relate To
Imagine going out to dinner with one of your YouTube viewers. Chances are, the two of you will talk about what you have in common during the meal. You might be nervous at first, but you’ll eventually hit a groove where you’reusing shared lingothat stems from your similarities.

If you both love dogs, for example, you might use words like:
Writing video titles is no different. The headline starts a conversation between you and viewers, and relatable dialogue is best.
Consider this video title fromZeusy the Pitty'schannel:“This Talking Pitbull Is Smarter Than You Can Imagine!”
If you're familiar with pit bulls, you know how vocal they are. It’s almost as if they can speak! When the creator adds “talking pitbull” to the title, it’s a nod to people who adore the vocal nature of pitties.
2. Stay Under the YouTube Title Character Limit
Make sure you're using the right YouTube video title length before settling on a headline. It’s easy to fall in love with the words you’ve written, only to realize you have too many!
On YouTube, you have a title limit of 100 characters. But even that’s too long. The best titles are around60-70 charactersand display fully on most devices. Anything longer will show up as a truncated title.
3. Avoid YouTube Clickbait Titles
It’s true: Sensational headlines attract viewers out of sheer curiosity. Even if something looks too good to be true, viewers will investigate just to be sure.
Because of that,YouTube discourages clickbait content– including video titles.
One example could be a video titled “Buying a Mansion for $1 Million.” If the creator drives around to look at expensive homes with no intention of buying, renting, or even discussing that journey, it’s clickbait.
4. Use the Right Keywords for YouTube Search
SEO (search engine optimization) iseverythingon YouTube. If people aren’t searching for the kind of videos you make, getting views as a new creator is tough.
So, before you press upload,create a YouTube video title with solid keywords. Start by studying your niche to see which phrases competitors use in their videos. Then usevidIQ’s keyword research toolto double-check your findings.
The goal is to find terms with high search volume plus low to medium  competition.

5. Use Numbers When Necessary
Adding numbers to headlines is an old marketing rule that still works today. According to aneye-tracking study from 2007, people pay special attention to numbers.
The study explains thatpeople love numbers because they’re associated with facts. So if you want people to click your titles, don’t skimp on the numerals.
6. Add Emotive Words to Your Title
Did you know 95% of the time, peopledecide to make purchases with their subconscious mind? Choosing to watch a YouTube video doesn’t cost money, but it’s still a subconsciousdecisionbymost people.
That means you shouldexplore what viewers feel subconsciously as they browse YouTube. What emotions arise when they think of specific topics?
Once you know this, it’s easier to write titles that stick. You’ll know which emotive words to use, such as “lucrative” for finance geeks or “blissful” for hopeless romantics.
Here are more examples of emotive words:
Need more examples?Here's how to tap into three emotions that make people click videos: curiosity, fear, and desire.
7. Create Harmony Between the Title and Thumbnail
When people create YouTube video titles, the thumbnail is typically an afterthought. But that’s a costly mistake.
No title exists in a vacuum because the headline appears beside the preview image on YouTube. So it’s wise to consider how the two combine to attract viewers.
If the title doesn’t build upon what the thumbnail shows, it's not accurate or strong enough. Do your best to create real harmony, like the thumbnails we paired with these titles.
8. Add Hashtags in Your YouTube Video Title
You want hashtags in your titles because they help viewers find content similar to what they’re already watching. If your title has a hashtag like #growyourchannel, your content could show up on thehashtag page for channel growth.
We accomplished this feat on the vidIQ channel. Below, notice we added #growyourchannel to a video titled “YouTube Settings You Need to Know to Grow Your Channel.”
Four years later, that video is still featured on the #growyourchannel hashtag page.
Here’s how to add hashtags in a YouTube video title:Type the # symbol in your title or description, then start typing the best terms for your topic. YouTube will suggest some popular hashtags; all you have to do is choose the best one for your video.
9. Get Inspiration from Other YouTube Videos
Did you know that seasoned creators don't always brainstorm their video titles? Many of them look at channels in their niche and pull inspiration from videos that went viral!It takes time to research those channels, so we'll save you a bit of trouble here. We recently interviewed title expert Jake Thomas, who studies trends within the YouTube video space. According to him,these emotion-driven titles are working for creators:
Viewers get curious when they see these titles, and that motivates them to click on the video!
10. Use AI for a Creative Boost
Similar to the tip above, this piece of advice is about usingallof the shortcuts available to you. And AI — artificial intelligence — goes a long way in aiding the creative process on YouTube. So, why not use it to write captivating titles?
If that sounds like productive, check ourAI Title Generator for YouTube. It's free to try and generates10 titlesfor every video description you provide. Plus, the ideas are optimized for viewer engagement!
11. Write Wholesome Video Titles for YouTube
Lastly, be mindful of thecommunity guidelineswhen you’re naming YouTube videos. Steer clear of profanity, hate speech, and misinformation that's harmful in the real world.
How to Title YouTube Shorts
YouTube Shorts are vertical videos of 60 seconds or less. They're typically shot on a mobile phone, and viewers usually discover them through the Shorts player. This is a section of the YouTube app that's designed forinfinite scrolling,and yes, title do matter there! The rules for writing them are just a tad different.

How to Start a YouTube Channel: 10 Brilliant Tips
Starting a YouTube channel has many benefits, some of which are too enticing to ignore. The first perk? You get to create content from the heart and share it with like-minded viewers around the world. And eventually, you'll build a community where thousands of people (or even millions) look forward to watching your videos.
If all of that goes well, you'll reach a point where you can monetize your videos,earn a full-time income, or even build a business.
But, remember: You aren't the only person trying to become a content creator on YouTube. There are millions of channels, and the people behind them want the same thing as you: creative expression, financial freedom, and a community.

That's why you should learnhow to start a successful YouTube channel. With so much competition, you'll need tips and strategies to begin your journey the right way.
1.Create a Google Account
This is where it all begins. If you haven’tcreated an account on Googleyet, it’s very simple. Simply sign up by filling out your name.
Next, you have to provide some more basic information about yourself.
And it’s that easy! You now have a Google account.
It’s good to have a Google account to create your YouTube channel, simply because of the ecosystem that Google has built. Even earning on YouTube happens through a Google AdSense account,which is fairly easy to set up.

Add a Banner and Video Watermark to Your Channel
At this point, you can also add a banner and video watermark to your channel.

Try to communicate what you want to achieve on the channel and how it benefits your audience. If everything is cohesive, you'll have a good-looking channel!
3. Find Your YouTube Niche (Channel Topic)
Your niche is the main topic you'll explore on your YouTube channel. It's also the reason most people will watch your content, as some viewers are attracted to specific topics.
And there are plenty to choose from:
But if you really want to stand out, find a nichewithina niche. For example, you might create a channel about how to cook Caribbean food instead of focusing onallcooking styles, like American, Italian, Spanish, etc. Your broad niche would be "cooking," and your sub-niche would be "Caribbean recipes."
Need help finding your YouTube niche? Or ideas for starting a YouTube channel?Here are seven tips to discover your channel's main topic.
4. Identify Your Target Audience
Once you've found your niche, imagining who will watch your videos is much easier. And that's something you want to do sooner rather than later.
Here's why:
Some of this knowledge comes as you build an audience. But even now, you can guess a few things about your potential audience.
Let's say you want to create a channel about working remotely around the globe – becoming a digital nomad. Your audience might be younger adults in their 20s or early 30s who can afford to travel non-stop. They might not have established any roots or started a family yet, which allows them to move from country to country.
Do they need tips on international travel? Do they dislike staying in one place for too long? Does it matter what time you post on YouTube if your viewers are global citizens?
These questions help you plan content around viewers' lives.
5. Create a Value Proposition for Your Viewers
So far, you've discovered your channel's topic and who your viewers are. Now it's time to make a promise to everyone who comes across your content.
We'll call this promise a value proposition. It's a brief statement that explains what your channel is about and what viewers gain by watching your videos.
Here's an example: "Creator-obsessed YouTube education." That's our value proposition for the vidIQ channel, and it makes two things clear:
Having a slogan like this does more than help viewers understand you; it also helps you make the right content. You can avoid making videos that don't align with your mission or viewers' interests.
6. Find Your Competitors on YouTube
As a YouTube content creator, it's important to know who your competitors are. It's not that you need to battle with them all the time. Or try to upstage their videos so your channel gets more views than theirs.
More than anything, having competition inspires you to make better videos. It gives you another creator to watch, learn from, and measure your content against. And when you're ready, sometimes it makes sense tocollaboratewith competitors because you sharing overlapping audiences.
You can do some light YouTube research to see which channels are similar to the one you're planning. All you have to do is type common topics or queries into YouTube's search bar (related to your niche) and see which channels pop up.
But when you've created 15-20 videos, you can usethis guideto create a more accurate list of your biggest competitors.
7. Create a List of Video Ideas
It's helpful to have a few video ideas before you start posting on YouTube. That way, you'll spend less time thinking and more time creating. Pretty soon, you'll build momentum instead of wondering,What should I film next?after each upload.
YouTube video ideas come from many places. You can research:
You can even recreate YouTube videos that already exist, taking the time to add something new and insightful to the conversation.
But if you need more guidance,here are seven incredible ways to develop video ideas.
8. Test Your Video Ideas with Keyword Research
Now that you have a list of video ideas, it's time to test their popularity on YouTube.
One way you can do this is with keyword research. This is the process of discovering which words viewers use to search for videos on YouTube.
For example, someone might type "spinach gardening" to see videos that show them how to plant and grow spinach. Another viewer might type "become a realtor" to find other real estate agents who can explain that career path.
If you know which search terms your potential viewers are using, you can get more views on YouTube. All you have to do is add those relevant terms – in other words, YouTube keywords – to your video titles and descriptions. That small but impactful task tells the search engine which viewers to serve your content to.
Want to know which search terms align with your video ideas? Or how many times a month viewers use specific keywords?Read this guide to learn the basics of YouTube keyword research.
9. Get the Right Equipment for Your YouTube Needs
How much does it cost to start a YouTube channel? That's what many new creators want to know.
The short answer is it doesn't cost a thing. You don't have to spend any money when you go to YouTube and set up your channel today.
The long-term cost comes after you create your channel. But the exact number depends on the type of videos you want to make.
Realistically, you might need any of these items:
In the beginning, you could probably get away with using your smartphone to record videos. But some content requires more than that.
If you're recording tutorials indoors and the lighting isn't great, you might need external lights. But lighting won't be your problem if you're vlogging in the sun all day. Then it might be producing quality audio or needing a tripod to balance your camera. It truly depends on the content.
10. Post Your First Video
This is what you've been waiting for all along: to post your first YouTube video. And now that you've found a niche, identified your audience, developed video ideas, and more, you're ready to take that leap.
Here's how to upload a YouTube video:
1. Go to YouTube.com and click the camera icon near your profile picture.
2. SelectUpload Videofrom the menu.
3. Drag and drop videos into the upload space or clickSelect Filesto browse for videos on your device.
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete your upload!
Bonus Tips
1. Learn How YouTube Works
Sometimes, YouTube gets confusing when you approach it as a creator and not just a viewer. There are many things to research, such as how to make better videos, get monetized, and measure your progress along the way.
But you can start by learning the YouTube basics:
The links above will give you an overview of YouTube so you can start growing your channel.
2.Create a Diverse Content Plan
YouTube now has multiple formats through which you can raise serious, sustainable revenue. So, try everything out!
For example, you can create Shorts with the goal of reaching viewers beyond your niche. Shorts don't take as long to create, so it’s feasible to pump out shorter videos instead of longer ones. Although the earnings are still not enough if you’re just monetizing Shorts,one viral video can change the game for you!
Livestreams, on the other hand, are generally longer andrequire some monetary investment for the equipment and software you'll need.And unless you have a strong core following, you won’t be getting thousands of views on the first try. But over time, streaming provides a new way of making money on the platform with Super Chats. And since YouTube makes the video-on-demand version available instantly, you can monetize them like long-form videos.
All in all, it’s important to try things out and see what works.Keeping an open mindmight lead you to find the ideal type of content mix for you and your channel!
Now that you've created your YouTube channel, learn how to get more subscribers as a new creator!

Title: Can Ad Blockers Tank Your YouTube Views and Watch Time?

Can Ad Blockers Tank Your YouTube Views and Watch Time?
If you use an ad blocker on your browser and have tried to watch a YouTube video recently, you may have seen a prompt like this pop up:
The prompt reads:
“Ad blockers violate YouTube’s Terms of Service."

“It looks like you may be using an ad blocker. Video playback is blocked unless YouTube is allowlisted or the ad blocker is disabled."
“Ads allow YouTube to be used by billions worldwide at no charge."
“You can go ad-free with YouTube Premium, and creators still get paid from your subscriptions."
YouTube's stance against ad blockers has been a topic of heated discussion among creators and viewers alike. While ad blockers may seem like a convenient way to skip through commercials, their impact on the YouTube ecosystem is far-reaching.
Let's delve into some critical questions to understand why YouTube is cracking down on ad blockers and what it means for everyone involved.
Why Is YouTube Taking a Stand Against AdBlock?
Ever since the adpocalypse in 2017, ads have contributed the lion’s share of revenue for most creators. And, YouTube has consistently earned lots of ad revenue in comparison to other platforms. So, it’s necessary to keep the advertisers happy and returning to the platform year after year, and adblockers stand in total opposition to this.
In fact,YouTube reported a significant fall of 2.6% year over yearas advertisers pulled back from the platform due to economic uncertainty. YouTube raked in $6.69 billion in advertising revenue in early 2023 compared to $6.87 billion during the same period last year. So, it makes sense for YouTube to become proactive now!
How Does This Affect Your YouTube Channel?
Even if you aren't monetized, YouTube's new approach to ad blockers could affect your channel. The first two sentences of the error message (above), emphasize that YouTube is responding to ad blockers byblocking video playback.
“It looks like you may be using an ad blocker. Video playback is blocked unless YouTube is allowlisted or the ad blocker is disabled."
A monetized creator will feel the sting of this, but not as sharply as someone who isn't monetized yet. New creators need every video view and every ounce of watch time toqualifyfor the YouTube Partner Program and get monetized. It's hard to do that when your videos aren't being shown to some viewers!
How Does This Affect YouTube Overall?
YouTube shares ad revenue with creators, offering them healthy pay for their efforts. Ad blockers cut into this shared income, affecting the platform's financial health.
So, the revenue generated from ads helps YouTube invest in new features and improve user experience.
Plus, these benefits are also at stake if ad revenue disappears:
With reduced revenue, YouTube might find it challenging to support creators, which could lead to a decline in content quality.

How to Increase Views, Revenue, and Watch Time Despite Ad Blocking
Now that you know how ad blockers affect your channel, is there anything you can do to keep your metrics high? Absolutely!
Explain to your audiencehow ad blockers hinder you from creating the content they love. In the same way that you ask for likes and comments, ask your viewers to disable their ad blockers. Emphasize that you love your community and you want to be there for them always. If they can't watch your videos due to ad blockers, it's almost impossible to build that relationship.
You can also direct viewers toYouTube Premium, a service that allows for ad-free viewing.
YouTube Ads Are Here to Stay
In an interview with The Verge,YouTube made it clear that using ad blockers is a no-go according to their Terms of Service. However, YouTube will warn viewers of that fact and ask them to disable any ad blockers. If the requests are ignored, that's when playback may be disabled.
The crackdown on ad blockers is not just a move to protect the platform's revenue but also an effort to sustain the community of creators who rely on that revenue.
So, the next time you think about using an ad blocker, consider the bigger picture and how it impacts other creators.
And if you're not monetized yet, don't make these three mistakes with your channel!

How to Get More YouTube Subscribers on a Small Channel
Are you looking for the best way to get more subscribers on YouTube? You're in luck because this post has11 awesome strategiesto grow a small YouTube channel from scratch! We'll show you how to get discovered by the right viewers, convince them to hit subscribe, and attract loyal fans for years to come.
But that's just the beginning. With these tips, you can join the YouTube Partner Programmuchfaster than before.
For instance, you can easily reach500 subscribersand monetize your channel with fan-funding just by following these tips. Or you can grow your channel to1,000 subscribersand start earningYouTube ad revenuefrom your videos! As long as you have a YouTube niche (a topic you want to explore), you're ready to get started!

1. Search for High Volume, Low Competition Keywords
To get discovered on YouTube, it's best to enhance your content with keywords.A keywordis a word or collection of words that allow search engines, particularly on YouTube, to understand your content and recommend it to viewers. You can place keywords in video titles, video descriptions, chapters, and even captions.
However, you'll get views faster if the keywords have high search volume and low competition.
Our newest tool, global rising keywords, will help you find popular, non-competitive terms for your channel.Sign up for vidIQand get started for free!
2. Write Titles and Descriptions that Spark Emotion
Crafting video titles (and descriptions) that pull an emotional response out of viewers is a game-changer. Whether it's curiosity, excitement, or even controversy, intriguing titles are what bring viewers to your channel so they can eventually become subscribers.
Title writing is a skill that takes years to develop. But you canwrite captivating  titles todayby simply adding power phrases to them, such as:
These conversation starters are designed to put viewers onhigh alert. They'll wonder,What am I missing out on? What does this person know that I don't?
Take this same approach when writing your video description, which should give an accurate summary of the video and get viewers excited to click on it. Don't forget to add relevant keywords throughout!
3. Create Videos that Target Your Viewers' Desires
Connecting with viewers is about more than chasing the right topics. It helps to knowwhypeople care about those topics so you can cater to the deeper, stickier desire they're feeling. Those details are usually hiding within a sub-niche!
How Sub-Niches Reveal Deep Desires
For instance, let's say you have a YouTube channel for camera enthusiasts. Whileresearching keywords, you notice that viewers are using popular search terms like "how to create cinematic videos" and "how to make colors pop in a video."
Reading those keywords, it's clear that viewers aren't merely interested in cameras as a technology;they want to be filmmakers!
In this scenario, you would geta lotof subscribers on YouTube by making videos andplaylistsaround thatcore desire— not just cameras.
4. Use YouTube Shorts to Drive Viewers to Long-Form Content
YouTube Shorts are a fantastic way to get discovered, but let's be honest: 60 seconds isn't a lot of time to fully engage a viewer. The real magic happens in your longer videos. So, why not use Shorts as a teaser for your meatier content? This is easier than ever withrelated content links, a new feature YouTube announced in September.
Related links appear near the bottom of a YouTube Short and direct viewers to a video of the creator's choosing. That could be a livestream, a long-form video, or another Short they created. However, linking to a longer video will help you generate more subscribers on YouTube.
5. Study and Master YouTube Storytelling
Telling good stories on YouTube— not just making lots of videos — is the key to growing your subscriber count quickly. A compelling video makes people stick around for longer, engage with more content, and understandwhythey should subscribe to you.
You don't have to learn storytelling from scratch, though. There's a proven format used in movies, books, and even TV shows to keep audience members engaged. It's called the three-act story structure.
6. Create a Video Series Based on Your Viewers' Interests
Creating a series is an underrated way to gain more subscribers on YouTube. It gives your existing subscribers something to look forward to while making your channel look more attractive to new viewers. If your series solves a core problem for viewers, such as making more money, beating a video game, or cooking on a budget, they'll find a reason to stick around.
To get started, identify which topics or videos have the highest engagement on your channel. Thenbuild a video seriesaround them!
7. Create Unique, Remixed Versions of Popular Videos
Running out of video ideas is a problem many people face on YouTube. But what if we told you that YouTube is filled with ideas you can remix and mold to your perspective? To get started, you just need to knowwho your competitors areand what their popular videos are about. Then you can add something unique to the conversation!
This doesn't mean copying other creators outright; it means rehashing and reinterpreting those ideas through your own creative lens. This will attract viewers who enjoyed the original content but are looking for something fresh. And remember: Fresh channels are bound to gain fresh subscribers!
8. Ask Viewers What They Want to Watch
While you may have launched your YouTube channel as a platform for self-expression, remember that you're ultimately creating content for an audience. One of the most effective ways to earn their trust and loyalty is to involve them in the video-making process.
How can you do this? Consider running a YouTube poll to ask viewers which videos they want to see next! This, hands down, is the easiest way to get more subscribers on YouTube for free. You're seeking direction from the people you serve, and you can't go wrong with that approach!
9. Identify Videos that Attract Subscribers
The best way to add more subscribers to your channel is by identifying videos that turn viewers into subscribers.
In the YouTube Studio, go to Analytics > See more > Subscribers by content. This will show you a list of videos that attract the most subscribers to your channel. Study the list carefully, then devise a plan to make similar videos in the future.
Plus, this is a great way toget 1,000 subscribers on YouTube!
10. Close Your Content Gaps
On YouTube, a content gap is any video that's missing from your channel, especially when compared to your overall niche. For example, an ice cream channel may have covered everything about the sweet treat, including flavors, textures, and colors. But what aboutwaffle cones?That's a content gap if the ice cream channelisn'tcovering that topic while othersare.
And just imagine: What if viewers are interested in the topic, but the creator just isn't making that video? They're losing out on crucial views that may lead to subscriptions.
Closing these gaps doesn't take much effort — just observational research! Go to other channels in your niche and see what they're posting on YouTube. If you notice ideas and concepts that aren't on your channel, pick up your camera and start recording them!
11. Try New Video Ideas While Retaining What Makes You Special
YouTube moves fast, so keeping up is imperative if you want to see thousands of people flock to your channel. That's why experimenting is such a fantastic idea when you're just starting out. It never hurts to try new video ideas or storytelling formats because that's the best way to learn your audience. Just be careful not to abandon the spark that makes you...you!
Before you make a new video, ask yourself three questions:
If you can say yes three times, it's a good idea to try!
Growing a Small Channel Is Tough, But Not Impossible
We know growing a small channel isn't easy, so these aren't your everyday, run-of-the-mill tips. They are unique strategies to help you stand out and find your footing as a creator.
Remember, every big YouTuber started with zero subscribers, just like you. So keep creating, keep engaging, and most importantly, keep being you!
In the meantime, learn 8 ways to help viewers subscribe to your channel.

Title: Why Subscribers Aren't Watching Your YouTube Videos (And How to Fix It)

Why Subscribers Aren't Watching Your YouTube Videos (And How to Fix It)
Is your subscriber count on YouTube rising while views on new videos seem to be falling? If so, your channel may be going througha period of stagnation. Ideally, you want thousands of views from subscribersandnon-subscribers to grow your channel.
It's a dilemma many YouTubers face, so today, we're sharing tips and tricks to help you overcome it.
The Double-Edged Sword of Views: Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers
First off, it's important to say that both types of views — those from subscribers and new viewers — are important. However, you need these views to be in syncso your channel grows steadily. You want new viewers to discover you, watch a few videos, and return to see evenmorecontent.

If that's not happening on your channel, the cycle is broken somewhere. You might be getting views from newcomers, meanwhile, loyal subscribers are moving on. Or, you might be getting all of your views from subscribers only. The best scenario is to have bothtypes of viewers invested in your channelso that loyal fans stay and new viewers arrive.
Subscriber vs. Non-Subscriber Views: Why You Need Both
By now, you know that every channel needs views from subscribers and non-subscribers. And there are plenty of benefits to achieving this balance!
What you gain from "subscriber views":
What you gain from "non-subscriber views":
How to Get Subscribers to Watch Your Videos
Now that you have some background knowledge, we can tackle the big question. Why do some subscribers avoid returning to a creator's channel? It could be a range of issues, from posting sporadically to not making the type of content that attracted viewers in the first place.
Either way, we have a few tips to fix the problem!
1. Audit Your Content to See What's Wrong
First, identify the disconnect between what you're posting and what viewers want to see. Take a look at your recent videos and compare them with your older, more popular ones. What's changed? Is it the content, the style, or maybe even the video length?
Action Steps:
2. Re-Engage Your Community
The number one rule of growing any audience is, "don't be a stranger!"
Engage with your subscribers both on and off YouTube.Reply to their comments, ask for their opinions, and make them feel valued.
Action Steps:
3. Experiment, But Don't Alienate
It's okay to try new things, but don't stray too far from what your audience loves about your channel.
Action Steps:
4. Harness the Power of Playlists
Create YouTube playliststhat have a mix of your new and top-performing videos. This encourages people to binge-watch your content and leads to more views and watch time.
Action Steps:
5. Up Your Consistency
Viewers decide to hit that big, white "subscribe" button on your channel for a good reason. They want to keep up with your channel and its content, so give the people what they want!
Action Steps:
Master the Cycle of New Versus Returning Viewers
When it comes to channel growth, we can summarize everything in this post with one YouTube metric: new versus returning viewers.
If you have mostlyreturning viewers, you're doing great on YouTube and growing at a steady rate. But you can reach new viewers by experimenting with other video topics or storytelling formats.
If you have mostlynew viewers, this is where things get tricky. It's good to attract new audiences, but you must retain their viewership to grow your channel.
Ideally, you want to see the trend highlighted below. This criss-cross pattern of new and returning viewers means you're attracting more peopleandconvincing them to come back. This is the balance you need to skyrocket your views.
But if you need more help, click here to learn the secret formula for gaining and retaining YouTube subscribers!

Title: 11 Killer Tips for Starting a YouTube Gaming Channel in 2023

11 Killer Tips for Starting a YouTube Gaming Channel in 2023
Starting a gaming YouTube channel is no easy feat. Millions of people play video games in their free time, so naturally, the competition is stiff.
You have famous creators likePewDiePie,Mumbo Jumbo, andDanTDMdominating the space with billions of YouTube views. TheMrBeast Gamingchannel has a whopping 31.4 million subscribers. Beyond that, you have thousands of small channels worldwide to compete with!
That makes it difficult for new creators to stand out, let alone go viral. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.

How to Start a Gaming Channel: 11 Killer Tips
Is it worth starting a gaming channel in 2023? We’d say 100%yes.Here’s how to grow your gaming channel fast in 11 powerful steps.
1. Focus On Your Target Audience, Not a Particular Game
When you start your YouTube channel, it’ll be tempting to play every single game you own at home. You may upload some Fortnite videos because of the game’s insane popularity. Two weeks later, it may seem like a good idea to sprinkle in some Minecraft content.
Or maybe, you are highly ranked in a game that you've been playing for years, and you're planning to upload the sickest montages ever!
But heed our warning, creators. If you want to grow your gaming channel, don't run after the games. Instead, chase the audience.
This a smart move to make because while some games become less popular over time, viewing habits remain largely the same, as explained in this video:
If you have a target audience in mind, you can produce the content they like to watch and build a dedicated, core group of viewers. And good for you, because this is howthe bestgaming communities are made!
2.  Get the Right Equipment for Your Gaming Channel
What equipment do you need for a gaming YouTube channel? Not much, if we're being honest — but a few items will make your videos more enjoyable:
3. Choose the Right Name for Your Gaming Channel
Naming your channel is one of the most important things you’ll do on YouTube. So regardless of your niche, try to follow these best practices as you narrow down your list of options:
Many successful gamers have named their channel based on the primary game they play. So, if you’ve settled on playing just one game, use its title to develop aunique YouTube name for your channel.
If you want to go in a different direction, such as building a personal brand, then be creative with your channel name. You can use your first and last name or a different moniker to let your personality flow through and stand out on YouTube!
4. Avoid the ‘Let’s Play’ Trap
Many gamers love to post "let's play" videos on YouTube, and we honestly can’t blame them. They’re fun to make and easy to edit, unlike other types of videos on YouTube. All you have to do is record yourself playing a game while sprinkling in some commentary for your audience!
Read More:How to Reach 1,000 YouTube Subscribers with Gameplay Videos
While let's plays are a lot of fun, it's hard to get decent views from that type of content unless you're a large, established channel. After all, the let's play space is crowded and competitive. It's a popularity contest at this point, and small creators have to go another route because no one knows who they are yet.
Here's a video example of your typical let's play on YouTube. GameriJeventakes on a mission in Minecraft, which is episode one of a much larger series.
While this video is enjoyable, most viewers are searching for tutorials, hacks, and speedruns for Minecraft — not a let's play video. So if you decide to do a let’s play, make the video searchable. Include a tutorial or a hack so you canwrite a good title for YouTube’s search engine.
5. Join a Gaming Community to Find YouTube Video Ideas
Brainstorming video ideas is the most challenging part of growing on YouTube. But the solution is simple: Don’t try to go it alone. The best way to start a YouTube gaming channel is in the company of other gamers.
Read More:4 Honest Reasons Why You're Running Out of YouTube Video Ideas
To start, try joining an online community like Discord. Find a group centered around the game you play, then pay attention to what people say.
You’ll discover:
These three points can lead you to exciting video ideas!
6. Upload Weekly Gaming Videos
Before you create a gaming YouTube channel, make a pact with yourself to upload consistently. You shouldpost at least once a weekto build and grow an audience on YouTube.
Why this number? YouTube has gotten good at serving content to the right audience. So whether you post four videos a month or one video a day, YouTube will recommend your contentif it's optimized well.
So don’t burn out by following an insane posting schedule. Go slowly. That way, you’ll understand how YouTube fits into your life, whether that’s striking a balance between school, work, or family time.
7. Make Your Video Introductions Brief and Entertaining
On YouTube,audience retention is everything. If someone lands on your video but doesn't get past the first 30 seconds, that sends a negative signal toYouTube’s algorithm. It indicates your video may not deliver on its promise and shouldn't be recommended to more viewers.
To ensure this never happens, create a strong introduction for each video. Instead of showing your game’s menu screen as you talk, get to the meat of your content. Move your character(s) around the game’s landscape as you explain the point of today’s video.
The goal is to make it impossible for someone to click away. The title of your video makes a promise to viewers, and you should deliver on that promise early and often.
8. Create Enticing YouTube Thumbnails and Titles
Video titles and thumbnails are what genuinely bring in viewers. They convince people to click on your content, so this powerful pair should be optimized 100% of the time.
A video title isn’t just for display; it can also help you climb YouTube search results. If you can find popular keywords on YouTube that aren’t too competitive, you’ll be one step closer to creating fantastic, click-worthy titles.
But ranking higher on YouTube is half the battle. Once you’ve done that, your video’s thumbnail should encourage more clicks.

To do your best in this area, keep the graphic simple but eye-catching. It should be easy for viewers to understand in seconds, like this one:
9. Research Video Topics Before You Press Record
Before you make a video, brainstorm some title options. This may seem weird at first but trust us: You need this hack. You’re better off brainstorming titles and seeing which keywords are popular for that topic so you can increase your video's reach.
Read More:How to Find YouTube Keywords that Grow Your Channel
Plus, this plan forces you to make the best video without even knowing it. First, you’ll optimize your content for YouTube’s algorithm by finding valuable keywords. Then you’ll run some YouTube searches to see what other creators posted. All of that research will tell you if the video is worth making, and how you can improve upon what's already out there.
10. Turn Gaming Trends Into YouTube Videos
A trending topic presents a huge opportunity toget more views on YouTube. You can take advantage of pop culture, holidays, gaming news, or anything that adds something positive (but relevant) to your channel.
And once again, we’ve got a tool for that.
After you’vesigned up for vidIQ, check our most viewed videos tool within the extension. It’s a helpful little gadget that lets you see topics trending in your niche.
In the vidIQ extension, you can quickly access the tool via the real-time stats bar. Here's what that looks like:
If you click the drop-down menu and selectMost Viewed, this window will open in your browser:
When you think you have your next video idea, input some keywords you might rank for in this tool. You may discover that no creators have posted about the topic in months.
Depending on how many views per hour the topic is getting, you may have an opportunity to compete with older videos on YouTube.
11. Experiment with YouTube Shorts
YouTube Shortsare for people watching brief YouTube on their phones. They’re great for making funny videos, quick explainers, or anything that doesn't require a long, traditional video.
They’re also perfect for the gaming community.YouTube Shorts capture those hilarious, gut-busting moments that happen during gameplay, like when a character tumbles off a ledge or there's an unexpected glitch. Even when you have nothing funny to share, you can film 60-second tutorials.
When you’re ready, post a few Shorts to your YouTube channel. We've seen gaming channels grow with this content, and we’re not talking about small spurts here and there. It’s possible togain 1 million subscribers in three months.
Speedrun Your Way to Monetization
As a gaming channel, you have plenty of options for monetizing your content as your channel grows:
Then again, there's always the most prized monetization route, which is turning on ads. You can also start aYouTube channel membershipthat allows viewers to join your channel through monthly payments and get extra benefits like badges and access to exclusive content.
Are Gaming Channels Profitable in 2023?
One of the more lucrative aspects of making a gaming channel is making serious money from it. And yes, even in this day and age, it is still possible! According tothis articleby Statista, in 2022, the revenue from the worldwide gaming market was estimated at almost 347 billion U.S. dollars, with the mobile gaming market generating an estimated 248 billion U.S. dollars of the total.
In fact,the top gaming channelshave some of the highest revenue metrics on the entire channel. Creators likeMarkiplierandTechno Gamerzearn upwards of $150,000 per month on estimate.
Starting a gaming channel would usually require a high-end PCthat could cost you anywhere between $1000 and $2000. But, if you can use the tools at your disposal correctly and keep at it, you can make back the money and much more!

Title: 3 Types of YouTube Channels that Never Get Monetized

3 Types of YouTube Channels that Never Get Monetized
Most creators want toget monetized on YouTube, but their channels don't always pass the "content test." This is where YouTube looks at everything on a channel — the titles, the thumbnails, the popular videos, and more — to decide if it's a fit for the YouTube Partner Program. If it is, the creator can monetize videos with advertisementsandmake money from fans directly.
So, what stops creators from doing this? Most of the time, it happens when they violate a serious rule on YouTube that can't be ignored. So, here are three channels that never make it past YouTube security!
1. Channels with 100% Reused Content
One of the quickest ways to get demonetized (or not monetized at all) is by reusing other people's content on YouTube. Today, many creators repost viral clips without transforming them at all, such as adding original commentary, new visuals, or compelling edits. And that's what YouTube doesn't want to monetize — videos that are carbon copies of something else.

Why These Channels Don't Make Money
YouTube values original content. If someone takes a video and reposts it with no value added, it doesn't make sense to pay them for it. It's unfair to the originator, and stealing content leads to a flurry ofcopyright claims and strikes.
Examples of Reused Content
2. Channels with Repetitious Content
Repetitive content has the potential to be boring, and YouTube knows this. So, it's a good idea to avoid using the same thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and video content over and over again. It's safe to use the same intros and outros or reference clips from older videos, but keep the bulk of your content original.
Also, try not to mass-generate your videos using only AI (artificial intelligence). Give your content a human touch and let AI assist or enhance the process.

Why These Channels Don't Make Money
Advertisers are looking for engaging, original content where their ads can be placed. If a channel is just churning out the same stuff repeatedly, it won't attract advertisers or be approved for monetization.
Examples of Repetitous Content
3. Channels that Violate YouTube's Community Guidelines
YouTube has a long list of guidelines that aim to keep everyone on the platform safe. Channels that engage in dangerous acts are in direct violation of those rules, which means they can't make money. YouTube has the power toremovethose channels altogether.
Specifically, YouTube doesn't allowspam, deception, disturbing or sensitive content, violent or dangerous content, misinformation, and the glorification of regulated goods.
Why These Channels Don't Make Money
When a channel engages in activities like hate speech, harassment, or spreading misinformation, it becomes a high-risk platform for advertisers. Brands don't want their reputation tarnished.
Examples of Community Guidelines Violations
Which Channels Get Monetized on YouTube?
Are you ready to turn your channel into a money-making machine? The good news is that it'smore than possible. You just need three qualities to pull it off:
Other than that, YouTube monetizes channels that offer original, engaging, and advertiser-friendly content. Thinkeducational tutorials, entertaining vlogs, insightful reviews, or even captivating storytelling. It all works on YouTube and paves the road to monetization.
Speaking of cash, here's how to boost your advertising revenue when you do get monetized.

Copyright
Copyright is a big deal on YouTube. You'll visit this sectiona lotto make sure you haven't "stolen" content from other creators and to keep your channel in good standing.

Title: How Much Does YouTube Pay For 1,000 Subscribers?

How Much Does YouTube Pay For 1,000 Subscribers?
Every time we hear the words "1000 subscribers," getting monetized on YouTube is the first the we think about. We're willing to bet most creators have the same thought!
But to earn the most money from your videos, you need to reach the highestmilestones for monetization: 1,000 subscribers and either 4,000 watch hours or 10 million YouTube Shorts views. Then you can join the YouTube Partner Program and earn money from fan-funding and advertising revenue.
It sounds promising, buthow muchdoes YouTube pay when you have 1,000 subscribers? The answer isn’t as straightforward as the question itself.

3 Factors Affecting Your YouTube Revenue
A handful of factors will influence your earnings on YouTube, and in the video above, we discussed the big three. So, fellow content creators, let's take a look at what those are.
Read More:How to Get 1,000 Subscribers on YouTube (Fast and Free)
Your YouTube Niche
YouTube has become a vast platform with many profitable niches that cater to different audiences, and the one you choose can significantly impact your earnings. For example, finance and tech channels are often more lucrative than lifestyle or entertainment channels. The former exists in a bigger market, which means bigger payouts overall.
In this article, VloggerPro talks about the most profitable YouTube niches in 2023. If you don't know what kind of content to make or want to spice things up, check it out. You'll get an understanding of what works on YouTube.
Plus, here are some YouTube niche ideas that viewers like!
Read More:The 37 Best YouTube Niches, According to Viewers
Audience Location
It's good to know the basic demographics of your audience. Things like the age of your viewers, the gender split on your channel, and the languages they speak can be enlightening for any creator.This helps you build an audience personato understand viewers better and develop a winning content strategy.
But, when it comes to revenue, the only relevant data here is the geographical location of your viewers. Channels with a majority of viewers from theUnited States, Canada, and the United Kingdomtend to make more money.
Video Engagement Rate
By now, we're all well aware of what YouTube ideally wants for its viewers. It is to create a binge session for them and keep them on the platform for hours on end. And if your videos help with that, you're definitely on the right track.
Highly engaging videos that keep viewers watching for longer periods can result in more ad placements, thereby increasing your earnings. This usually results in improved video engagement metrics such as an increased number of likes, comments, views, and watch time.
How Revenue Is Measured on YouTube
The first thing to understand about YouTube revenue is that it's measured through a metric calledYouTube RPM. This stands for revenue per mille and captures a rough estimate of how much you made after deductions. We're not talking about taxes, though. RPM is your take-home pay after YouTube gets its cut of your advertising andfan-funding revenue.
Read More:Understanding YouTube RPM and Your Channel's Real Revenue
For example, an RPM of $5 means a creator made $5 for every 1,000 views on YouTube. And this would include advertising revenue as well as earnings from Super Thanks, Super Chats, and Channel Memberships.
According to Statista, the average CPM, or how much money advertisers paid YouTube per 1,000 views,was $9.63 in 2021.
So we can safely assume the average RPM is under $9.
So, How Much Does YouTube Actually Pay For 1,000 Subscribers?
In this video, we highlight creators who shared their actual earnings on YouTube after getting 1,000 subscribers. And, by the way, these earnings represent one month of uploading on YouTube!
1. Mikhaxl
Mikhaxlhas 8,690 subscribers — a small channel by most creators' standards. But this hasn't stopped them from making hundreds of dollars with just 1,000 subscribers. This goes to show that hot niches like finance are more valuable in the market and can result in higher RPMs.
Watch the video below to hear their story:
2. Irina Dee
Irina Deehas a few focuses on YouTube, from housing to personal growth to teaching content creation. We typically advise creators to focus on one niche, but it looks like Irina is earning more money through experimentation!
Watch the video below to hear their story:
3.Tu Ngo
Tu Ngoruns agaming channel, and this topic is pretty popular on YouTube. But it looks like companies aren't paying a lot of money to advertise on gaming videos — at least, not like finance or real estate ones. This channel's RPM of $4.93 is among the lowest on the list, but it's more realistic for most creators.
Additional Revenue Streams
Setting realistic expectations for making money on YouTube is crucial from the get-go. While reaching 1,000 subscribers is a significant milestone, it's just the beginning. And it'll likely be a while before you see significant numbers on your paycheck, especially if you're limited to ad revenue.
In the video above, Rob also highlights the importance ofdiversifying your incomeon YouTube. Affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and merchandise sales are excellent ways to supplement your YouTube earnings.
Earn Money Faster
With fan-funding, YouTube has really opened up the game for smaller creators. All you need is 500 subscribers to access Super Chats, Super Thanks, and Super Stickers, and earn money directly from the people who love and support your content.
How Much Will You Make with 1,000 Subs? It Depends
As we mentioned before, the answer isn't straightforward because your niche, geography, and video performance play a significant role. Be prepared to accept that this takes time to build, and it's best to think of your channel as a long-term business.That is the right mindset for massive YouTube success!

Title: YouTube Watch Time: 9 Ways to Reach 4,000 Hours and Monetize Your Channel

YouTube Watch Time: 9 Ways to Reach 4,000 Hours and Monetize Your Channel
If you're reading this, you probably know that getting4,000 watch hoursis a critical checkpoint on the road to YouTube monetization. It's not easy, and many creators spend a year or more getting there, but it's ultimately worth it. Achieving this goal means you can monetize your videos with advertisements through theYouTube Partner Program, which is a lot likemaking money in your sleep. It's a hands-off way to boost your income!
Understanding Watch Time on YouTube
But first, what is watch time, and how is it calculated on YouTube?
For your watch time to count toward monetization, you must gain 4,000 viewing hours in 12 consecutive months. The videos don't have to be published in the last 12 months, as long as viewers watched them over the previous year.

Also, only certain types of videos can collect watch time. Make sure you're getting 4,000publicwatch hours, as this is the main qualifier — so don't set your videos to private!
Read more:YouTube Monetization — Which Videos Count Toward 4,000 Hours of Watch Time?
Do You Need 4,000 Hours to Join the YPP?
Notably, you don't need 4,000 hours to get into the YPP.You can do that with just 3,000 hoursand then monetize your videos through fan funding instead of ads. These include Super Chats, Super Thanks, channel memberships, and more. Below are the minimum requirements to join the YPP, but remember thatyou'll still need 4,000 hours to earn ad revenue.

Finding Your Channel's Watch Time
So, how many watch hours have you collected so far? Knowing this number is extremely helpful, especially when building a strategy to keep viewers' attention.
1. Go to the YouTube Studio and clickEarnin the left navigation bar.
2. On the Become a Partner page, scroll down toHow to Join. And there, you'll see how much watch time your channel has.
How to Get More Watch Time on YouTube: 9 Powerful Tips
Now that you know where you stand, use these powerful tips to increase your watch time on YouTube.
1. Master the Art of YouTube Storytelling
Telling a good storyis crucial for keeping viewers engaged, and thus, boosting your watch hours on YouTube. In every video, you want to grab viewers' attention, take them on a journey, and create emotional scenes that hook them along the way.
To do this effectively, master three areas of YouTube storytelling:
Titles and Thumbnails
Your title and thumbnail are like two sides of the same coin. They should give viewers a snapshot of what the video is about and communicate how it willfeelto watch it. For example, notice how the creator's dread in this thumbnail reinforces the video's title: "Big Mistakes Small YouTubers Still Make."
Video Introductions
The best introductionsget straight to the point by mentioning what viewers care about in the first three seconds. If you're struggling tocome up with hooks, study the best–performing YouTube Shorts and the introductions they have. Introductory phrases like "They don't want you to know this secret" or "I never do this, and here's why" are effective curiosity drivers.
Emotional Triggers
Emotion makes your content 10 times more relatable. Try usingemotional triggerslike fear, nostalgia, novelty, and scarcity to make your videos seem urgent and relevant to the viewer's life.
2. Increase Engagement with Pattern Interrupters
A good story may pique viewers' interest, but knowing how to edit that story is the real watch-time booster.
Pattern interruptersare your secret weapon for this. They turn a good video into a great one by adding variety to what's already there. On YouTube, a pattern interrupter is any visual or auditory element that changes someone's thought pattern.I should leave this videois one thought you want to interrupt in a viewer's mind!
Some examples of pattern interrupts include:
3. Use Captions Throughout Your Videos
Getting someone to watch your video for longer is much easierwhen captions are present. Think about it: "Reading along" takes pressure off of viewers who don't want to listen to a video or have some degree of hearing loss. Plus, viewers in crowded, noisy areas benefit from reading captions versus listening to audio.
Additionally, subtitles should be your go-to if you have a multicultural audience on YouTube. They translate your audio into multiple languages so people in faraway regions understand you better!
4. Skip the Basic Outro
Filming a long outro feels natural, but did you know there are better ways to close out a video? Most viewers click away when they hear goodbye phrases, such as:
Instead of announcing the end of a video, leave before anyone knows what's happening. Your watch time will improve when you don't signal that a video is ending.
5. Make Evergreen YouTube Videos
Evergreen content is popular year-round, so you need those types of videos to get watch time fast. Evergreen topics like how to change careers, how to cook brown rice, and tips for making friends in your 30s have a high search volume from January to December.
As you can see, many evergreen videos aresearch-basedand offer steady watch time through sheer popularity.
If you're struggling to find evergreen video ideas, ask yourself a question:
For example, vidIQ subscribers love to hear growth tips for small channels. One of our videos on the subject has over 78,000 watch hours since it was published six months ago. And the hours arestill increasing!
6. Host YouTube Live Streams
Watch time from streaming will always count toward your 4,000-hour goal, so bond with viewers in real-time. It's the perfect way torack up those monetization hours!
When we started our live stream journey, 50-100 people showed up. Now we get hundreds of concurrent viewers, and with that boost in viewership comes plenty of additional watch time.
For example, check out the watch time from this two-hour live stream:
Give streaming a chance when you have about 12 months of YouTube experience. By then you should have 100 or more subscribers who may show up to watch your streams.
7. Build Watch Time Through Playlists
Why do people binge videos for hours on Netflix? Simply put, it's because their shows are organized with the help ofplaylists. Viewers don't have to keep selecting episodes when they want to watch a romantic comedy or learn about nature through a documentary. They click on a show, and Netflix plays the episodes automatically.
This is an excellent strategy to bring to your YouTube channel. Figure out which topics viewers care about the most, then create YouTube playlists that hold 10 or more videos. It's one of the easiest ways to increase your watch hours!
Read more:How to Grow Your Channel with YouTube Playlists
8. Use End Screens to Build Watch Time
YouTube end screens are interactive outros that appear in the last 5-20 seconds of a video. You can add all sorts of clickable elements to them, such as website links, a subscribe button, or even a YouTube channel you want to promote. But it's wise to "send" viewers to the rest of your content if you want more watch hours.
So, instead of creating an "outro," make your last point, then quickly transition to an end screen. Now you can recommend one more video to viewers!
Read more:YouTube End Screens — How to Make Cool Video Outros
9. Upload Videos Consistently
YouTube's recommendation system has one job, but it's a pretty big one. It has to suggest the right content to viewers based on their watch history and other factors.
YouTube can do this faster and easier if you're always making videos. After all, how can the algorithm rely on any channel for quality recommendations if there isn't much content?
You don't have to upload every day, but stick to a schedule that keeps viewers engaged and doesn't burn you out.

FAQ: More Details About YouTube Watch Time
Can I watch my own YouTube videos for more watch time?
You can press play on your own videos, but doing so to increase your watch time isn’t a good idea. According toYouTube’s Fake Engagement Policy, the platform “doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics.” Plus, many creators have found thatYouTube deletes viewscoming from their own browser after 48 hours.
Do YouTube Shorts count as watch time?
Unfortunately, watch time from Shorts does not count toward the 4,000 hours you need to join the YouTube Partner Program. Those hours must come from regular videos. An alternative route is getting 1,000 subscribers plus10 million public Shorts views in 90 days.
Should I buy YouTube watch time hours?
You should never buy YouTube watch time if you want to keep your channel in good standing. Instead, focus on making high-quality videos that bring viewers in naturally. After all, purchasing fake engagement could lead to strikes against your channel, a suspended account, or channel termination.
Should I make longer videos to get more watch time?
Don't make long videos just to reach 4,000 hours.You should make your videos just long enough to cover a specific topic. When viewers get bored and abandon a video, that hurts your watch time.
What's an underrated way to increase my watch time?
Become obsessed with audience retention.The longer people watch your videos, the more watch time you'll receive. How many people are still watching after the 30-second mark? Are viewers watching until the end, or do they watch 50% of a video on average? These are questions you should ask to create better content.
Reach Your Watch Time Goals on YouTube
To wrap up, there are seven powerful ways to get more YouTube watch time:
And while you’re working on those steps, learn the best secrets to get 1,000 subscribers.

Title: YouTube Automation: How to Avoid Copyright Claims on Faceless Channels

YouTube Automation: How to Avoid Copyright Claims on Faceless Channels
How does afaceless YouTube channelmake thousands of dollars using other people’s content? It seems impossible now that YouTube is dishing out copyright notices, and yet, creators are still getting monetized.
Some will say they got lucky, butNoah Morrisknows the truth. You have to beextremelycareful when starting a YouTube automation channel, especially with copyrighted material. That's because YouTube automation — the process of using AI or freelancers to create, edit, and publish videos — is hard to accomplish without referencingothervideos.
If you’re wondering,Who is Noah and how does he know any of this,great question! Noah isn’t a legal expert, but he’s a genius at running automated YouTube channels. In fact, he oversees 20 of them. They pull in six figures each month, so Noah has seen his fair share of claims, disputes, and lawyers.

Read more:The Truth About AI: Can YouTube Automation Ruin Your Channel?
Our goal is to help you avoid any hiccups, so here’s how to dodge copyright claims on a faceless channel.
What Is Copyright?
Before we dive into the deep stuff, let’s cover the basics.A copyrightgives the owner of a creative work the exclusive right to use, distribute, and monetize their intellectual property. That could be a song, image, movie, book, TV show, or countless other creations.
How YouTube Handles Content Theft
YouTube doesn’t like creators using copyrighted material in their videos unless they have permission from the owner. If they don’t have permission, YouTube issues acopyright claimwhen it detects “stolen” content in a video.
Creators can dispute these claims, but acopyright strikeis more serious. A strike occurs when a creator notifies YouTube that their content has been used without their permission. The copyright owner can request that the video be removed, or they can choose to monetize it for their benefit. But after three strikes, YouTube can delete your channel permanently — a devastating consequence for any creator.
Read more:Copyright Claims vs. Copyright Strikes: Here's the Difference
The Four Pillars of Copyright
Making automated content is tricky, but it gets easier when you understandcopyright law, particularly on YouTube.
When there's a copyright case, U.S. law examines:
Fair Use and Transformative Content
Now that you know what copyright law examines, we can answer the burning question. How do creators make money using other people’s work? This typically happens throughfair useandtransformative content.
In U.S. copyright law, you can sometimes use small parts of someone else's work for things like reviews, news, teaching, or research without asking for permission or paying the owner. This is called fair use, but it isn't a guaranteed way to make money from YouTube automation.
To fully cover yourself, you shouldtransform the materialin a valuable way.
How to Dodge Copyright Issues with an Automated Channel
Want to automate your channel in the safest way possible? Keep reading to learn how, or watch the video below for a visual guide!
1. Don’t Just Borrow Clips — Build a Storyline
The simplest way to dodge copyright claims is totell a storywith the clips you've gathered. Bring your educational insight or perspectivefirst, then use copyrighted content to support your views.
For example, taking a video from one channel and posting it to another with a few edits isn't fair use. The creator would have to addmore valuethan the copyrighted clip itself.
2. Avoid Content from High-Risk Sources
Some copyrighted content is more risky to use than others. These sources include:
These entities have lawyers and a system for tracking theft, so you’ll get in trouble pretty quickly for using their content.
It's better to use low-risk sources, like bodycam footage, public domain works, news clips, and documentaries used for educational purposes. It’s also safer to find user-generated content, i.e., someone who recorded cellphone footage of a “copyrighted event" (the Super Bowl, for example).
3. Diversify Your Content Sources
Some creators think their videos are more likely to get demonetized if they use several copyrighted clips. But, according to Noah, it’s the other way around. Sourcing a variety of materials, instead of one, is the safest option on YouTube.
4. Use Clips that Are Less Impactful
If you’re going to use a copyrighted clip, make sure it isn'tthe most important partof the original work. That increases the likelihood of a copyright claim because you’re using the heart of a story — not the supporting pieces. Typically, the heart of the story is significant, impactful, and easy for YouTube or the copyright holder to spot.
For example, it’s a good idea to avoid plot twists that made a movie "famous" overnight. Or a scene that everyone references from a popular TV show. If it's well-known, try to pick something else.
5. Use Shorter Clips
It’s always wise to use shorter clips when it comes to copyrighted material. There’s no set duration to ward off YouTube claims or strikes, but it's harder to detect a three-second clip versus a 10-second one, according to Noah.
Just make sure you aren’t showcasingthe heartof another creator’s work, and you’ll have a better success rate.
6. Space Out the Copyrighted Clips
Once you have a bunch of clips to use, try mixing them up as best as you can. Use 10 seconds of someone else's content, then switch to 10 seconds of yourself talking or another piece of original content. Then keep alternating like that for the rest of the video. This makes it harder for YouTube to realize you're using copyrighted content.
7. Ask Yourself: Am I Stealing Attention from the Copyright Holder?
One way to get demonetized is to use someone else's work in a way that outshines them.
A good example of this is using copyrighted clips to make compilation videos on YouTube. These montages rarely offer a new perspective, and they tend to rely ononecopyrighted source, which is dangerous in itself.
For example, imagine that you want to create a montage of the funniest scenes in the movieBring It On.SinceBring It Onisa comedy, one could argue that collecting the funniest moments reveals too much of the movie. And what happens if more people decide to watch the compilation rather than buy the film? That hurts the copyright holderandtheir business, which may lead to a copyright strike.
Automate Your Channel the Right Way
Some creators may feel like automated channels have no place on YouTube. But those channels, for whatever reason, are thriving on YouTube. Why not study them and learn how to automate your content in a safe, monetizable way?
If that sounds like fun, here's a step-by-step guide to building a faceless channel!

Title: How to Write the Best Titles for YouTube Shorts

How to Write the Best Titles for YouTube Shorts
As a content creator, it's wise to approach long-form videos and YouTube Shorts differently — especially if the goal is to get more views. After all, viewers don't engage with these content types in the same manner. According toCreator Insider, Shorts are discovered, watched, and enjoyed at a different pace.
The biggest difference of all? Things like titles, thumbnails, and hashtags are crucial for longs but not as dire for Shorts. The Shorts player serves up videos in a never-ending carousel and doesn't ask you to choose anything based on "decorative" elements.
Does that mean youshould notwrite good titles for your Shorts? Quite the opposite! There are plenty of reasons to optimize them, even when viewers are scrolling at lightning speed.

Read More:4 Tips to Grow Your Channel with YouTube Shorts
Why Video Titles Still Matter for Shorts
Before we get into the nitty-gritty, look at the layout of the YouTube Shorts player. You'll notice a few things in the following order:
Admittedly, the title of the Short appears near the bottom. You might think,That's too buried for anyone to notice, but YouTube is drawing attention to this area withrelated links!
Related Links in Shorts Are Title-Based
With related links, a viewer can now watch your Short, spot a link at the bottom, click on it, and view additional content on your channel. That could be a live stream, long-form video, or even another Short! And, by the way, those links aretext-based;YouTube pulls them from the title of the related video.
So, if you want additional views,you're going to need two things:
For that reason alone, it makes sense to craft the best video titles for your Shorts!
Shorts Can Be Viewed as Regular Videos
Remember how we said Shorts are showing up in YouTube searches? This means shorter videos can also be viewed as regular YouTube content, complete with advertisements and a comment section.
That's right! Your title serves a dual purpose on YouTube. It gives context to related links in the Shorts playerandhelps your content rank higher on search pages — especially when using relevant keywords.
Crafting the Best Title for YouTube Shorts
So, how do you write a title that does justice to your Short? Here are some actionable tips:
1. Accurately Summarize the Video
Your title should give viewers a snapshot of what to expect. Misleading titles might get you clicks, but they won't win you fans.
2. Spark Curiosity
Make your audience wonder what's in the video. Pose a question, or use intriguing adjectives. The goal is to make them stop scrolling and start watching.

3. Use Relevant Keywords
Yes, we're talking about SEO (search engine optimization) for Shorts. Incorporate keywords that are both relevant to your content and what your audience is likely searching for. But remember, while keywords are important, they're not the end-all-be-all.
4. Keep it Short and Snappy
You have 40 characters to work with before YouTube truncates the rest of your title (when viewing Shorts in the app). So, be mindful of character limits. You want to make an impact, and that starts with a completely visible title.
The Algorithm's Perspective
While you might be tempted to stuff your title with hashtags and trending keywords, know this —the algorithm is smarter than that.Its primary focus is on how well your Short engages and satisfies the viewer. So, while a compelling title can boost your visibility, it's the content that ultimately reigns supreme. No amount of clever metadata, be it hashtags or titles, can make a Short more enjoyable or impactful.
Title Writing Is a Skill
Crafting the best title for YouTube Shorts isn't just about slapping a few catchy words together; it's a deliberate skill, and when done right, can boost your video's success.
So, aspiring YouTubers, take this knowledge and run with it.Your next viral Short could be one, well-crafted title away!

Title: 6 Places to Find Trending YouTube Topics for Your Videos

6 Places to Find Trending YouTube Topics for Your Videos
An important question pops up on the road to more views and subscribers:
The truth is that, sometimes, you have to look outside the platform. The best trending topics for YouTube are all over the internet, and the more places you look, the more trends you'll find!
Here are six reliable places to begin your search.

1. Browse the Google Trends Website
Remember how we said the best trends happen outside of YouTube? Well, Google Trends will help you discover those moments. This tool shows the popularity ofanytopic on the internet over an extended period of time.
Here’s how to use Google Trends for YouTube purposes.
Option 1: Trending Searches
1. Go toGoogle Trendsand clickTrending Nowin the left navigation bar.
2. Select a country, then browse the first two tabs on the screen: daily search trends and real-time search trends.
Thedailyoption shows what’s been trending in the last few days, and thereal-timeoption shows searches that are trending right now. Both results should give you a general idea of what’s popular online.
Option 2: YouTube Search
1. On the Google Trends homepage, type something into the search bar — preferably a topic related to your channel. As an example, we’ll use “pumpkin spice latte.”
2. Choose a region, time period, category, and then selectYouTubefor the search type.
Analyze the graph to see how popular your topic is. In this example, “pumpkin spice latte” is picking up steam as fall approaches.
Want to go even deeper? Scroll down and view therelated topics/queriespanel. You’ll find even more topics related to your original search that could spark great video ideas.
2. Check the Trending Tab on YouTube
If you're wondering how to see trending topics on YouTube, look no further than the explore section. Below that, there's atrending tabshowing the most popular videos on YouTube right now.
Head to theYouTube homepage, then clickTrendingon the left navigation bar.
This page will show you the top trending videos on YouTube by category: music, movies, gaming, and more. It’s not as detailed as Google Trends, but it’s a great place to see what’s happening within different niches.
3. Discover Trending Searches on YouTube
As a busy content creator, sometimes you just need to know what people are searching for on YouTube. vidIQ has a new tool that can help you out with that, and it's calledglobal rising keywords. It shows you which YouTube searches are rising in popularity so you can take advantage of them!
The tool will show you:
For example, the search term "Colorado vs. Oregon" (referring to U.S. football) rose in popularity by1,200%today! The keyword score is 61, which means it has high search volume and not much competition! You'd have a decent shot at getting more YouTube views.
By far, this is the best way to see YouTube search trends on the rise.Click here to sign up for vidIQ for free, then navigate toour web appto see the data you need!
4. Find Hot Topics on TikTok
TikTok is where trends are born. If you want to know what’s trending right now (or will eventually trend on YouTube), it makes sense to open TikTok.
But “watching videos” is only the first step. If you want to get up to speed much faster, explore trending videos and hashtags in the TikTok Creative Center.
Go to theTikTok Creative Center, then select theTrendstab. From there, you can view trending hashtags, songs, videos, and creators who also end up on YouTube!
5. Get Daily Video Ideas (with Performance Predictions)
If you’re looking for video ideas that fit your channel,Daily Ideas from vidIQcan help. Every day, you'll getthree video ideaswhen you sign up for a free vidIQ account.
But these aren’t justanyold ideas. We use artificial intelligence to suggest video ideas that match your content!
Plus, each video idea comes with aperformance prediction: low, medium, high, or very high views. With that type of data, you can choose in-demand topics for your channel. You can even see top-ranked videos for a particular subject.
Here’s how to get Daily Ideas for your YouTube channel:
1. First,sign up for vidIQ.
2. Go to theYouTube homepageand clickDaily Ideasin the left navigation bar.
3. Browse the idea cards. ClickSaveto store ideas for later orDismissto send them to the dismissed collection.
4. Click the list icon in the top right corner to see more video ideas at once. Select any idea to see top-ranked videos for the topic!
6. Discover Trending YouTube Topics on X
People go to X (formerly Twitter) to see what’s happening now – as inright now. That makes it the perfect place to find trending topics for your videos.
If you haven’t already, join X and follow some topics that relate to your YouTube channel.
For any topics you follow, you'll begin to see tweets related to those subjects in your feed. That makes it easier to see trends that would make great YouTube videos.
Now that you know how to find trends on YouTube, learn how to test those ideas before using them on your channel.

YouTube Algorithm Hack: Chase Watch Time and Engagement — Not Views
As the YouTube algorithm evolves, creators learn to prioritize different metrics on their channels. They might be interested in views, click-through rate, subscribers gained, and other markers of success. But did you know that the most obvious one, YouTube views,is notthe best catalyst for growth? In 2023, watch time and viewer satisfaction (also known as engagement) are clearly in the lead.
The truth is that it's hard to get more views without first satisfying your audience and making them watch longer. Only then does the YouTube algorithm recommend your content to more people!
Read More:Understanding the YouTube Algorithm in 2023

But, how do you strike the perfect balance between keeping your audience glued to the screen and ensuring they walk away fulfilled? Let's break it down.
Watch Time
Watch Time is often considered the holy grail of YouTube metrics.It indicates how long viewers stay on a platform and can impact a channel's ability to rank and gain suggested views. In many cases, watch time on YouTube is more important than the average viewer retention rate.
Of course, it is one of the essential factors for getting monetized, and for good reason. A high watch time for your channel would typically mean that viewers like to binge on your content and that’s one of the best signals to the algorithm!
Viewer Satisfaction
YouTube has been increasingly focusing on viewer satisfaction, which encompasses likes, comments, and overall engagement. With the help of these indicators, the recommendation system on YouTube learns how to serve the viewer the best possible video every time.
More recently, YouTube has also used surveys to ask the viewers directly about their experience on the platform, which makes the viewers feel more included in the platform. The positive response has prompted YouTube to make viewer satisfaction the central aspect of the new and improved algorithm.

Is Watch Time Better Than Views?
Ah, the age-old question. While views give you an overview of your content's reach, watch time offers a deeper look into viewer engagement. A video with fewer views but higher watch time often indicates content that resonates more deeply with your audience. So, if you're looking to build a loyal community around your channel,watch time should be your go-to metric.
Striking the Balance
Striking a balance between watch time and viewer satisfaction is essential for long-term success on YouTube. While watch time can help you climb the algorithmic ladder, focusing solely on it can lead to short-term gains. On the other hand, viewer satisfaction is about building a lasting relationship with your audience, which is invaluable for any creator.
In this video byCreator Insider, Todd Beaupre, who leads YouTube's growth and discovery team, emphasizes focusing on long-term satisfaction rather than just maximizing watch time. Todd advises creators to think about what their audience wants and find the best fit, as the algorithm will then match that.
So how do you balance watch time with viewer satisfaction? Here are some tips:
1. Go for Quality Over Quantity
In the age of pumping out content with AI, this advice seems counter-intuitive. But, instead of focusing solely on watch time, aim for content that provides real value. Whether it's a how-to guide or an in-depth review, make sure your videos offer something meaningful.
When viewers find value in your content, they're more likely to engage with it, binge it, share it, and discuss it with others. And soon enough, enable you tofoster a sense of community within them!
2. Make Engaging Videos
To boost your watch hoursandsatisfy viewers, make your content engaging from start to finish. Usestorytelling techniques,high-quality B-rolls, and even interactive elements like polls to keep your audience invested.
3. Monitor Viewer Feedback
Always keep an eye on the comments section and any feedback you receive through social media or direct messages. This real-time feedback is gold when it comes to gauging viewer satisfaction. It's also a good way to spot new video ideas!
Read More:How to Get Subscriber Feedback from a YouTube Analytics Deep Dive
4. Experiment and Analyze
Don't be afraid to experiment with different video formats and lengths.Use YouTube Analyticsto track how these changes affect both watch time and viewer satisfaction.
The YouTube algorithm is a complex beast that creators often find themselves trying to tame. It helps to keep an eye on your analytics to understand what's working and what needs improvement and act upon it.
Watch Time and Viewer Satisfaction Go Hand-in-Hand
If you satisfy viewers with the right content, you’ll see results in the form of an improved retention rate, higher returning viewers, and hopefully, more watch time! The key takeaway is to find the right balance.
So, go ahead and experiment, analyze, and most importantly, create content that you're passionate about. The numbers will follow. If you're a small creator looking to improve,then check out these quick fixes!

To ease the journey, YouTube will share AI-powered insights with creators, which they can use to make engaging content. The new tool will suggest video ideas and even providea content outlineusing powerful data and analytics!

So, be on the lookout for this new tool in the YouTube Studio! It could reduce the time you spend brainstorming and researching new video ideas.
AI Search Assistant for Creator Music
The best videos on YouTube have more than great visuals. They also use sound to create an atmosphere so enticing, you can’t help stay put, relax, and feel the vibe. YouTube knows this and wants to help you find the right backing tracks for your content!
And, fortunately, it’s not going to take hours. With assistive search for Creator Music, you can find tracks for your YouTube videos in no time. All you have to do is explain what you’re looking for, whether that’s upbeat dance music or chill, lo-fi beats. The search assistant will recommend tracks to you, which is much faster than browsing YouTube's Audio Library.
Dream Screen: AI-Powered Video Creation
In a few months, YouTube will test a new tool called Dream Screen. The name of this feature is spot-on because it sounds exactly like what it does. Whatever you can “dream of,” YouTube will place it in the background of your YouTube Shorts! Just describe what you want to see, whether that’s a cow jumping over the moon or rolling sand hills in a scorching desert.

It’s safe to say the future of AI is looking pretty bright, especially on YouTube. But could AI eventually replace human creators? If we had to guess, we’d say, “Not at all.” If anything, creators will have more access to AI, and they will use it to enhance their content.
So, get excited creators! When it comes to heavier tasks, like editing, dubbing, trimming, or even finding the right music, help is on the way.And, if you're interested in more ways to automate your channel, here's a handy guide.

How to Start a YouTube Automation Channel (up to $500K in 90 Days!)
Did you know that you can invest $250 into one YouTube video and make $20,000 in return? That’s someseriouscash. It may sound crazy or made-up, but this scenario, and those monetary figures, arereal.It actually happened on YouTube!
That stunning achievement comes fromNoah Morris, a YouTube automation expert who made seven figures in one year. He runs over 20 faceless YouTube channels that pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars, and he only works one day a week.
Luckily for you,we interviewed Noahto get an inside view of the automation world. In this guide, we’ll explain how to start your YouTube automation journey and get paid!

What Is YouTube Automation?
YouTube automation is the process of outsourcing the daily tasks required to run one or more YouTube channels. Some creators hire a team of people for this project, which involves designing thumbnails, scripting videos, editing, and creating voiceovers.
Others use a mix of human creativity and artificial intelligence. There are plenty of AI tools on the market now, and they do a decent job of video editing, voiceover, and other creative tasks.

How Much Does it Cost to Start a YouTube Automation Business?
There’s no perfect answer to this question, as it truly depends on the number of channels involved, the topics they cover, and the level of consistency on YouTube.
However, when we spoke to Noah, he said it took him about 12 videos at an average cost of $100 per video to break even. He also said beginners might need around 35 videos and $3,000-$3,500 to start seeing returns from automated content.
How Much Money Can You Make from YouTube Automation?
This number varies, but if we’re talking about thehighestpayout possible, it’s well over $100,000. In fact, Noah made twice that in one month with his automated channels.
And in just 90 days, he made $500,000 with automated content!
How to Do YouTube Automation with a Faceless Channel
Ready to get started? We’ll teach you how to choose the right topics, stand out on YouTube, and build a solid team that understands your automation goals! Watch the video for an in-depth explainer, or scroll down to read the tips and tricks.
1. Target a High-Paying Niche on YouTube
Did you know that some YouTube channels earn more money because of the topics they cover? It’s true! Some niches are extremely valuable and bring in thousands of dollars per month, if not hundreds of thousands.
If you want to be successful (and earn the highest AdSense revenue), Noah suggests focusing onsports, celebrities, and crime-related content because they lead to higher RPMs.
RPM stands for revenue per milleand is an estimate of what a creator makes from ad revenue and fan-funding on YouTube. An RPM of $10, for example, means you made $10 for every 1,000 video views on your channel.
Noah also says to target American viewers. They live in a bigger market and advertisers pay more to capture their attention (and money).
2. Find a ‘Content Gap’ in Your Niche
You can’t beat the best channels until you know what they are, what they do, and where you fit in. So, the next step is to find a gap in the YouTube market. Essentially, you’re figuring out how to “niche down” so you aren’t targeting broad, oversaturated topics that are hard to break into.
This part can be tedious, but Noah shared some tips to speed up the process.
How to Identify a Content Gap
If you can only find two or three channels with high views and low subscribers in your niche, those videos may represent a content gap on YouTube. This means people enjoy those videos, but few channels are supplying them! Make similar videos so you can stand out andgrow your channel.
3. Study Your Competition
Starting a faceless channel on YouTube is just as competitive, if not more, than starting a regular channel. So you need to learn how creators make automated content that feels fresh and entertaining. You should also know how and why those videos get millions of views.
The best plan of action is to study the competitionin your niche. Watch their popular videos and take note of what makes them successful on YouTube, whether they have good storylines, emotional appeal, or superb editing. Try to emulate all of that goodness within your content.
How to Stand Out and Diversify
Also, ask yourself,Which topics are missing from the conversation?You can answer this question by looking at channels in your niche that aren’t directly competing with your videos. If their content is related to yours (and performed extremely well), try those concepts on your channel too.
4. Build a Team
Now that you’ve found a lucrative niche and some video topics, it’s time to build your team! You need about four people to run a YouTube automation channel:
Scriptwriters
For scriptwriters, Noah suggests hiring someone who is passionate and knowledgeable about your niche. After all, they’re building the framework of your YouTube videos. You want them to be good!
Voiceover with AI
For voiceovers, you don’t necessarily need a human. You can generate AI voiceovers using tools likeSpeechifyandLovo AI.
Designers and Editors
According to Noah, finding a good thumbnail designer and video editor are the hardest parts of YouTube automation. An editor who spruces up videosspecificallyto hold viewers' attention is the best person for the job. Likewise, a thumbnail designer who provides a simple, attractive, and emotional snapshot of your content is a fantastic choice.
You can find both creatives, including scriptwriters, onYTJobs.com!
5. Keep Improving Your Videos
Your videos may be automated, but that doesn’t mean the work ends! You are the “director” of your channel, so it’s on you to understand the audience more and more each day. You want to improve your content,get more watch time, and influence the YouTube algorithm to recommend your videos.
Here are a few tips from Noah:
And, of course, always check your YouTube analytics to see which content attracts the most views, subscribers, and watch time.
Will YouTube Automation Hurt My Channel?
YouTube automation is legit when you do it the right way, and it’s totally worth it considering the money you could make. But keep in mind that YouTube does not reward repetitive, low-educational content.
If you’re automating a channel using wind or rain sounds on a loop, there’s a strong chance you won’t get monetized. You can use AI in the process, but make sure you’re creating original content viewers find engaging — preferably, something that has astoryline.

YouTube Shorts Monetization: How to Profit from Short Videos
As a short-form creator, you're probably wondering if you can monetize your YouTube Shorts like long-form creators monetize their videos.
The answer isyes!YouTube has several paths for monetizing short content, and this guide explains all of your options.
YouTube Shorts Monetization Requirements
One of the best ways to monetize your Shorts is through the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). Upon joining, you have access to all of YouTube's money-making tools, like the ability to place ads on videos or monetize your audience directly through fan-funding.

There are two ways to enter the YPP (you only need to choose one!).
To access fan-funding only:
To access ad revenue and fan-funding:
If you're a Shorts creator or someone who makes long and short videos, option 2 or 3 is your best bet for joining the YPP!
Image credit:Official YouTube Blog
Once you're in the program,only eligible Shortswill earn advertising revenue. So, do these four things to stay in the clear:
Monetizing YouTube Shorts Through Ads: A Quick Rundown
Earning Shorts ad revenueis a bit different from monetizing a regular YouTube video. Notably, all Shorts revenue is split between different parties, including the creators who make them and the music publishers who provide songs for those videos.
Image credit:YouTube Help center
Here is the 4-step process:
Can You Monetize YouTube Shorts Without 1,000 Subscribers?
If you're just starting out on YouTube, getting 500 subscribers is a quick way to join the YPP and monetize your Shorts. You won't earn ad revenue, but you can monetize most of your content — Shorts included — through fan-funding tools.
Earning Super Thanks
For example, with just 500 subs, you can collectSuper Thanksrevenue on your YouTube Shorts. These are "video tips" ranging from $2 to $50 that your fans can send to support individual videos.
Collecting Super Chats and Stickers
Super Chats and Stickersare an option as well, especially if you love streaming on YouTube.
When you host a vertical or horizontal live stream, viewers in the live chat can reward you with monetary donations ranging from $1 to $500. These can appear as Super Chats — colorful comments pinned to the top of the live chat — or as Super Stickers, which are fun, digital animations that appear on the screen.
Earning from Channel Memberships
Channel Memberships offer exclusive perks, such as members-only videos, badges, Community posts, emojis, and livestreams, to a creators' super fans. It's a great way to make money, but did you know that you can get your YouTube Shorts monetized through channel memberships?
After all, Shorts count as videos too! You can make these exclusive to your members just like regular, horizontal content.
How Much Money Will You Earn from Shorts?
Are YouTube Shorts monetized in a sustainable way? Can they become a side hustle or help you quit your day job?
It depends! Sometimes it's hard to make decent money from Shorts, and other times, you get a nice chunk of revenue. For example, we got$16.61for a vidIQ Short that got 468,500 views.
But some creators are able to make hundreds or even thousands a month in Shorts ad revenue. It all depends on the content you're making, the views you're getting, and if advertisers are payinghigh CPMs(aka advertising fees) in your country.
It's easier than ever to become a monetized Shorts creator, but you'll needviral Shortsto call this a real side hustle!
Brand Deals and Sponsorships
OK, so getting into the YPP to monetize your Shorts is a real challenge. You either have to go viral a lot or face the difficult task of earning 1,000 subscribers plus thousands of hours of watch time.
But guess what?You don’t have to join that race. There are other ways to make money from Shorts, and one of those golden opportunities is throughbrand sponsorships.
When a brand sponsors you, they’re paying you to advertise a product or service in one of your videos. That could be a new line of laptops, the latest leggings from Lululemon, or even a squeegee that removes pet hair from dirty carpet.
Here’s an example of a sponsored Short. In this video, actress Eliana Ghen advertises Vita, a mobile video editing app.
If you’re looking at this video and thinking,Hey, I could do that,you’re 100% correct.

But what if we told you it absolutelycanwork? What if we told you that viral YouTube videos aren't all that mysterious?

What Is a Viral Video?
Viral videos gain popularity through internet sharing, typically on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. In fact, Harvard Business Review reported that videos reach their viral peak faster when shared withinthe first 48 hours. Videos are considered 'viral' when they reach 2 million views (or more) in just a few days.
What Causes a Video to Go Viral?
Let's return to the HBR article to answer this question. In the post, HBR shares interesting data from Unruly, a marketing technology company that has studied 430 billion video views. The findings suggested thatsuper sharers— a small group of people who share videos in the first 48 hours — kick start the viral process.But why do they do this? Unruly noticed 10 motivators for sharing videos online.

What a Viral Video Looks Like
Viral videos evoke strong emotions which compel viewers to share them with their own networks. They have the potential to reach a massive audience within hours or even minutes after being posted!
But viral content doesn't need to have a specific 'look' to attract views. Oftentimes, this is what a viral video looks like on YouTube:
The important thing to notice here is the sheer difference between views and subscribers related to this video. This disparity means that the audience chose to watch the video for its content and not just the person behind it.
How to Make a YouTube Video Go Viral
Creating a viral video takes more than luck, as YouTube educatorSean Cannell has explained. It's more like cooking. Some ingredients are nice to have, but you can only mimic a dish when you have the main ingredients.
Strategies for Making Your Videos Go Viral
Strategy 1: Creating Compelling, Shareable Videos
The first step to creating a viral video is to ensure that it is compelling and shareable. People are more likely to share content that evokes strong emotions, etc such as laughter, awe, or surprise. So, try to be entertaining, informative, or thought-provoking while keeping the video short and concise to maintain viewers' attention.
What this typically comes down to is telling a good story. Make viewers feel giggly, happy, or sad, but no matter what, make them feel something. You can even surprise them with plot twists and cliff-hangers.
Strategy 2: Leverage Social Media
Social media platforms play a crucial role in making videos go viral. With billions of users worldwide, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter offer a vast audience for your videos to be seen and shared.
To leverage social media platforms effectively, consider the following tips:
Strategy 3: Optimize Videos with SEO
Search engine optimization (SEO) is a key aspect of virality.Optimizing your videosfor search engines can increase their visibility and improve their chances of going viral. If you've been putting a lot of effort into your videos, but they aren't seeing the big numbers, you could be lacking in SEO.
To optimize your video SEO, consider the following tips:
Strategy 4: Analyze Performance and Apply New Insights
The final strategy for making your videos go viral is analyzing their performance and iterating on future content. By analyzing data such as views, engagement rates, and shares, you learn what works and what doesn't.
To analyze and iterate effectively, consider the following tips:
Going Viral Is a Skill
It’s important to understand thatidentifying your unique voice as a creatorleads to the path of virality. Authenticity is the soul of what makes a video viral; it's what makes people relate to your content and share it with others. So, be yourself and let your unique personality shine through.
Creating a viral video might seem like finding a needle in a haystack, but it's not an impossible task. So, fellow creators, take heart. Your viral moment could be just around the corner, waiting for you to seize it!

Title: How to Get 1,000 Subscribers on YouTube (Fast and Free)

How to Get 1,000 Subscribers on YouTube (Fast and Free)
If you’re like most creators, you have a goal to get more YouTube subscribersand monetize your channel. You want to attract real viewers, make them fans, and earn lots of money from the video ads on your channel. The only question is, "How?"
First, you will needmanysubscribers to get paid on YouTube in a sustainable way — 1,000 to be exact.
Reaching this goal is one part of the recipe when it comes to joining theYouTube Partner Programand monetizing your videos with ads. The other part is reaching4,000 watch hoursin the last 365 daysor10 million YouTube Shorts views in the last 90 days.

Ready to get started? The good news is, with this guide, you'll never have to buy 1,000 YouTube subscribers to meet your goals.
Instead, we'll show you how to get 1,000freeYouTube subscribers!
1. Break Your 1,000-Subscriber Goal Into Small Chunks
First, here's a bit of raw honesty: Trying to collect a thousand of anything is hard. You know it’s going to take a long time, but you don’t know exactly how long. And that isnerve-wracking.
So, chop the goal into manageable chunks. Instead of saying you want 1,000 YouTube subscribers right now, tell yourself that you want to gain:
After all, it's less scary (and more encouraging) to go after smaller, realistic goals.
2. Create Videos for One Target Audience
It's important to focus on one target audience when you're chasing the 1,000-subscriber mark on YouTube. By honing in on a specific niche, you'll craft content that deeply resonates with like-minded viewers.
Let's say you're aiming at fitness enthusiasts; instead of broad workout videos, delve into niche topics like "HIIT workouts for beginners." This tailored approach will attract viewers who are genuinely interested in your content. They will engage, share, and crucially, subscribe!
It's hard to stand out as a creator, but you'll gain more subscribers on YouTube when you focus your efforts.
3. Create the Most Popular Kinds of Content
There are many YouTube video ideas online, but it's difficult to know which ones will connect with your viewers.
But there's good news: Regardless of your channel type, thesefour types of videosnever go out of style:
Reaction videosare highly entertaining on YouTube. People love seeing someone react to funny or dramatic events, so those videos will always be popular online.
Versus videosare appealing because everyone loves a hot debate: Samsung Galaxy or iPhone? Cats or dogs? LeBron James or Michael Jordan?
The other video types —how-to and listicles— answer questions people never stop asking. A how-to video could be titled "How to Negotiate a $10,000 Pay Raise." Meanwhile, a list video might be "30 Cheap Meal Plan Ideas to Save Money."
4. Take YouTube Keywords, Thumbnails, and Video Titles Seriously
You'll need custom thumbnails, relevantkeywords, and engagingvideo titlesto get 1,000 subscribers on YouTube fast. These are the first touchpoints that viewers have with your content, so make them count!
A compelling thumbnail grabs attention, while a well-optimized title, infused with relevant keywords, ensures your video surfaces in search results.
Imagine a viewer searching for "vegan recipes." If your video title is "Delicious Vegan Pasta Recipe" and is backed by keyword research, it's more likely to appear in their search. Pair that with an enticing thumbnail showcasing the mouth-watering dish, and you've got a click!
5. Create Videos That Deliver on Their Promise
Did you know that every YouTube video makes a subtle promise?
Everything works together to give the viewer anexpectation.
If a video doesn’t live up to the hype, it means you broke the initial promise you made to viewers. And on YouTube, 1,000 subscribers are hard to come by if you let people down!
To avoid this pitfall,create a value proposition for your channel,such as "tasty meals for every budget" or "high school math made easy." Make videos that align with your slogan, and you'll get your first 1,000 subscribers on YouTube in no time.
6. Identify Which Videos Attract the Most Subscribers
If you have 30 or more videos on your channel, why not see which ones attracted the most subscribers? The proper term for this metric is calledsubscribers gained, and you can find it in the YouTube Studio.
Here's how to navigate there:
1. Go to theYouTube Studio.
2. ClickAnalyticsin the left navigation menu.
3. ClickSeeMore,which is below the YouTube dashboard showing monthly views, subscribers, revenue, and watch time.
4. SelectSubscribers Gainedin the first filter box.
5. See which videos attracted the most subscribers. Make similar content to get more subscribers on YouTube!
7. Do a YouTube Collab to Reach New Viewers
Creators put a lot of work into video collaborations. They search for like-minded partners, brainstorm collab ideas, and film several videos together. But after all that hard work, the two creators earn a priceless reward. They get toshare their overlapping audiencesand fast-track their way toward 1,000 subs on YouTube!
Here's how it works: In collab videos, people will discover creator A and creator B for the first time. If things go well, some of these viewers becomenew subscribersfor both creators!
So, if you're serious about growing, it's time to collaborate on YouTube.Here are six tips to nail your first collab.
8. Promote Your YouTube Channel
To get people to subscribe to your channel, dedicate some time to promoting your videos to a wider audience. You have various options to do this, like posting on the YouTube Community tab,making playlists, and sharing on social media.
But that's just a small taste of what you can do. You can also:

9. Use 'Related Links' in Shorts to Get More Subscribers
Guess what? YouTube has rolled out a game-changing feature just for you:'related links' in YouTube Shorts. With 'Related Links', you can guide your Shorts audience straight to your long-form content, and turn them into loyal subscribers!
The best part is that it's super easy to set up. Just pop into your YouTube Studio, pick a Short, and link it to one of your in-depth videos. Make sure the two videos are related in topic and complement each other well. When you've saved the changes, a clickable link will appear near the bottom of the Short!
This new strategy isn't just about boosting views, although it never hurts to do that. Placing related links in your content is about building a community and turning those casual viewers into loyal subscribers.
10. Add a YouTube Subscribe Button to Your Videos
Want an easy way to get 1,000 subscribers on YouTube? Create an attractive subscribe button for your videos!
These little buttons are clickable and appear in the lower right corner of your YouTube videos. When viewers click on them (also known as video watermarks), they instantly become a subscriber to your channel!
11. Place a YouTube Subscribe Link in Video Descriptions
The description box is more than a holding place for your video's about section. You can also add links there, such as affiliate links, website links, and your social media profiles. More importantly, pasting in asubscribe linklets viewers join your community in just a few taps!
To create a subscription link, simply add "?sub_confirmation=1"to the end of your channel's URL.

Here's how to maintain aregular posting scheduleand boost the number of subscribers on your channel.

You can even use a YouTube end screento place a subscribe button on the last few frames of your video.

Title: YouTube Monetization Update: Key Changes for Video Ads

YouTube Monetization Update: Key Changes for Video Ads
Calling all monetized creators! Starting inNovember 2023, YouTube will take a more hands-on approach with ad placements on your videos. Instead of allowing you to select the ads you want to show, such as pre-rolls, post-rolls, skippable, or non-skippable, YouTube will make those decisions for you. Not only that, YouTube will decidewhenthe ads are shown andwhothey’re shown to across the world.
This means you won't have to manually insert video ads anymore; YouTube will place them along the best possible timestamps, effectively doing the hard work for you. But why is this happening?
It seems like YouTube isoptimizing the viewer experiencewhile ensuring that creators make the most money possible. It’s a win-win because creators will spend less time placing ads and (potentially) earn more ad revenue overall. But more on that later!

What Happens to My Watch Time If YouTube Handles My Ads?
If you're concerned about how this might affect your watch time, YouTube has some insights. Their data suggests that enabling non-skippable ads canincrease revenue by 5%, with only a minor decrease in watch time of less than 1%.
Additionally, activating pre-roll ads can potentiallyboost revenue by over 15%, with a watch time reduction of less than 5%.
So, yes — watch time will take a small hit, but the tradeoff is that you can make more money in the long run. This video has all the details, so give it a watch if you need more information about the update.
Can I Still Control YouTube Ads?
While these changes offer a streamlined approach, it's worth noting that thead settings of your existing videos won’t change. And for those who want to use mid-roll ads, you still have the option to place those manually.
For those who frequently livestream, there are updates in that arena as well. Creators can choose to let YouTube determine the optimal times for mid-roll ads during streams or set regular intervals, such as every 6, 8, or 10 minutes. However, if you're using third-party streaming tools, like StreamYard, be aware that they might not support these new ad features (yet).
These changes won’t impact every creator. But it's good to understand them as you navigate YouTube, the new ad settings, and the monetization goals you’ve set for your channel.
And, speaking of monetization, are you looking for ways to boost your YouTube AdSense revenue? This guide will show you how!

Title: YouTube Unveils 'Related Links' to Connect Shorts and Long-Form Videos

YouTube Unveils 'Related Links' to Connect Shorts and Long-Form Videos
Have you ever wondered why thousands of viewers will watch a YouTube Short but not the longer videos on a creator’s channel? It’s a common issue, and one that has bothered YouTubers since the beginning of the Shorts era. After all, long-form videos are easier to monetize. Whywouldn’tsomeone send more traffic there?
YouTube knows this, and that’s why the platform is introducingrelated links in YouTube Shorts. These are persistent links that appear near the bottom of the screen, sending viewers to a long-form videoof the creator’s choosing.
This update comes after a recent change on YouTube thatremoved clickable linksfrom every part of a Short: the comment section, the description, and even the live chat. So this update, which restoressomelink capacity, is sure to excite creators.

How to Put Related Links in Your YouTube Shorts
1. Go to the YouTube Studio and clickContentin the left navigation bar.
2. Find the Short you want to edit, then click the pencil icon beneath it.
3. Find theRelated videosection, then click that area.
4. Browse your content to select a long-form video to link inside of your Short.
Need a quick tutorial? Watch this video to see each step in real time.
How Do Related Links Work?
Link to Any Video You Want
Linking out to long-form videos from your Shorts is a smart move, but truthfully,you can link to any video you want. That means you can add a link to your latest livestream, a recent long-form video, and other Shorts on your channel!
Read more:Shorts, Longs, and Lives: How to Compare YouTube Views from All 3
The tool is fairly new, but you have some freedom when deciding which videos to recommend (although we suggest sticking to long-form videos).
What Related Links Look Like
On a mobile screen, related links look like video titles instead of buttons you can tap. They're positioned right below the title of a Short, and they have a small, white play button icon.
Look closer, and you'll notice there is also some somelink text. Viewers can click those words — pulled directly from the recommended video — to watch suggested content.
Who Can Access Related Links
Like most tools on YouTube,not everyone has access to related links.You’ll have to verify your YouTube channel first to unlock advanced features (like adding related links in Shorts).
Not Available on Mobile (Yet)
And finally, you can only add related linksusing a desktop computer. But we’re guessing it’s only a matter of time before YouTube enables this feature in the mobile app.
How to Get More Clicks on Related Links
The idea of connecting long-form videos to Shorts isn’t just intriguing; it’s incredibly exciting! But how do you get people to click on related links in the first place?
First,make sure the video you’re recommending is related to the Short.
For example, imagine that someone is watching a Short about growing organic bananas. The content link should be closely related to that topicandcomplement the Short that viewers just watched. A lengthy guide to growing organic bananas, which is relevant and helpful, would be an excellent choice.
Next,use a call to actionthat drives viewers to your related link. Ask them to tap the link below, then physically point to its location near the bottom of the screen. Do all of this while explainingwhythey should tap the link, and you’ll get more views.
A Solid Way to Grow Your YouTube Views
With YouTube's new related links, you've got another chance to boost your channel's overall views. Think of it as a bridge between your usual videos and those snappy YouTube Shorts you’re posting right now. Or even a bridge that goes from Shorts to livestreams!
Of course, you need more YouTube Shorts views if you plan on sending viewers to the rest of your content. So, here’s an awesome guide to help you crush it!

Title: How Does the YouTube Shorts Algorithm Work?

How Does the YouTube Shorts Algorithm Work?
Have you been feeling like your Shorts have suddenly stopped getting views? You're certainly not alone here! Most creators have seen their Shorts behave very differently from other forms of content, and it's almost baffling!
So,why do some Shorts go viralwhile others barely see the light of day? Keep reading, and we'll explain how the YouTube Shorts algorithm works!
The Algorithm: Explore and Exploit
Forget traditional metrics like impressions and click-through rates; in the world of Shorts,views are king. Compared to the traditional route of using impressions to test your content, the YouTube Shorts algorithm is more straightforward. So, if some of your Shorts look like the graph below, and you’re convinced that YouTube is out to limit your Shorts reach, we have good news! There is a reason why.

First, the Shorts algorithm operates in two distinct phases:explore and exploit.Initially, your Short is exposed to a small, targeted, “seed audience”. If this group engages well with your content, your Short gets promoted to a broader audience. That initial audience is crucial, because if they're not engaged, your views may become stagnant.
In an interview with Creator Insider, Todd Sherman, the product lead for YouTube Shorts, explains why this is the case. Unlike long-form videos, Shorts views mostly seem to come from the feed itself, and the element of a conscious choice on the part of the viewer is missing. So, the algorithm tests the Shorts for hundreds of thousands of views to determine its value. We can see the effect of this under the “Viewed vs. Swiped away” metric in analytics.
Swipe-away analytics are a new feature that can help you understand how viewers are interacting with your Shorts: Are they sticking around, or are they swiping away before the video ends? Here’s how to check it out:
1. Go to the YouTube Studio. ClickAnalytics, then click on theContenttab.
2. SelectShortsfrom the menu below.
3. On the right, you can see how many chose to view your Shorts and how many swiped away from them.
Extensive Shorts Research
What would you learn after studying 35 billion Shorts views on YouTube? Well,Nate Blackhas the answer! And our YouTube experts got some brilliant insights in a recent interview with him. In fact, they learned enough to help youbeat the YouTube Shorts algorithm.
Nate found out that Shorts that are either 13 or 60 seconds long tend to perform best. Additionally, there are specific categories, such as original showcases and sensory experiences like ASMR videos, that consistently attract more views.
He also observed that channels that have published at least 200 Shorts tend to see a consistent increase in views over time. So, before you get disheartened with your Shorts views, be sure to upload a lot of them! Also, the first three seconds of your Short are crucial for capturing viewer interest. Make them count!

Equipped with this knowledge, we must take care of certain factors when it comes to YouTube Shorts.
1. Timing Is Everything
Timing and consistency are key when it comes to Shorts. Knowing when your audience is most active and aligning your publishing schedule accordingly can significantly impact your Shorts' performance.
Fortunately, it's easy to find out the best time to post your Shorts. From the YouTube Studio, click Analytics and then theAudience tab.Scroll down to the “When your viewers are on YouTube” tab, and you'll see the best time to post on YouTube for your specific viewers!
2. Thumbnail Magic
Would you believe it, thumbnails still matter! And for Shorts, it’s the most visible asset of your video. When your Shorts appear in regular YouTube feeds,a compelling thumbnail can be your secret weapon for attracting more clicks.
3. Viewer Satisfaction
Viewer satisfaction remains a top priority, even in Shorts. A compelling hook within the first three seconds can make or break your content. Every Short should make a clear promise at the beginning and deliver on it by the end. Failing to do so can result in a less-than-satisfying experience for the viewer.
4. Experiment, Experiment, Experiment!
Consistency and experimentation go hand in hand. Don't be afraid to try different types of content to see what resonates with your audience. This might help you solidify the proper seed audience for your content!
The Silver Lining
Getting more YouTube views is always a hot topic, and we're guessing that's why so many of you want to understand the Shorts algorithm!
But some of you may be thinking, What do these views mean in the long run?Sure, the big numbers look good, but how do you translate that into more valuable, monetizable views?
Well, rest assured: the YouTube Shorts algorithm isnot brokenwhen it comes to attracting more long-form views. A new update on YouTube has addressed this very issue, and it’s a great first step!
A new feature will allow YouTube creators to include a persistent link in their Shorts, directing viewers to a long-form content. This feature aims to bridge the gap between Shorts and traditional YouTube videos. Watch the video below to learn more!

Title: Understanding YouTube RPM and Your Channel's Real Revenue

Understanding YouTube RPM and Your Channel's Real Revenue
Almost every creator who starts out on YouTube has the same goal, which is reaching monetization status. And most of the time, creators look at CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions), to understand how profitable their channel is. However, there’s a better way to see the monetary value of your content!
Unlike CPM, which is pretty outdated, RPM takes into account the various ways a monetized channel can generate income. Let's understand the difference better.
RPM vs CPM: The Two Metrics Of Monetization
First off, RPM is not to be confused with its close relative, CPM (cost per mille). While CPM focuses solely on ad revenue, RPM (revenue per mille) is the all-encompassing metric. It includes not just ads but channel memberships, Super Chats, and even YouTube Premium revenue. So while CPM shows you what advertisers are paying, RPM estimates what you'd earn after YouTube takes its cut.

And, by the way, YouTube receives 45% of your ad revenue and 30% of your fan-funding revenue.
Notably, RPMs do not show what you've actually earned, but they're closer to reality than CPMs.
Finding Your RPM: A Step-by-Step Guide
Like every other metric, you can look at the numbers on your YouTube Studio to find your RPM. Follow these steps:
1. Head over to the YouTube Studio and click on theAnalyticssection from the left-hand menu bar.
2. Next, open theRevenuetab in the top navigation bar and click onSee More.
3. From the drop down menu, select theRPMoption.
4. Take a look at your overall RPM for a specific date range. Notice how the vidIQ channel has an RPM of $2.73 and a CPM of $15.74 (for the month of August). CPM is typically the higher number, while RPM is more realistic.
If you want to calculate RPM for yourself, it's not too difficult. Take your total revenue for a given period, divide it by the total number of views you received, and then multiply by 1,000. Here's the formula to make it even simpler:
Fun fact, the average in RPM in 2023 is between $1.25 to $2.5.So, if you’re wondering,What is a good RPM for YouTube?,$2 or more is the sweet spot.
How To Boost Your RPM?
Ready to give your RPM a facelift? Here's how:
These actions will bring about a holistic change to your channel for the better and your improved RPM will reflect that!
What RPM Doesn’t Say
RPM may be the go-to metric for a snapshot of your channel's financial health,but it's not the all-knowing oracle. So, what's missing from the RPM narrative?
Here's where it gets tricky. RPM lumps together various revenue sources, making it a bit of a mystery box. You might see your RPM dip even when your views are soaring—why? Because not all those views are ad-enabled. On the flip side, your RPM could be climbing even if your view count hasn't budged, thanks to new Channel Memberships.
Our advice? Don't rely solely on RPM to gauge your channel's financial pulse. YouTube offers a smorgasbord of analytics to help you decode the fluctuations in your RPM. Use them to get the full picture.
Time To Get That RPM Up!
It may look like a long-winded process, but taking deliberate steps to improve your channel’s RPM is a crucial goal in the path to making it as a full-time creator.
RPM is more than just a number; it's a comprehensive look at your channel's earning potential. The next time you're knee-deep in analytics, give your RPM the attention it deserves. Trust us, your future self will thank you.
And if you’ve just unlocked monetization on YouTube, use these tips to boost your ad revenue!
