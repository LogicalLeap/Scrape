How To Best Organize Your Drawers
Organizing drawers effectively can create easy access to so many things. Good organization of drawers will help you find items quickly, clear surfaces and maintain clutter-free spaces. Here are some best practices to organize your drawers:
Declutter and Sort: The first step in organizing any drawer is to declutter. Decide what you want to keep, what can be donated or thrown away, and what belongs elsewhere. Sort like items together into categories and wipe the drawer interior clean.
Use Drawer Organizers:They are essential for keeping things in the proper place inside any drawer. We love thisdrawer organizer variety pack available on Amazon. It’s a good assortment for a great price. You can also find other similar single drawer organizers as well. Empty jewelry and small tech item boxes you already have lying around at home will work well too.
Frequent Maintenance:Organizing your drawers is not a one-time task. If frequently used items are not put back properly each and every time, systems will inevitably break down. Regular maintenance is essential—Chaos To Order can help, of course!
Remember that the best way to organize your drawers will depend on the specific type of items you need to store and the available space. Tailor your organization approach to suit your specific needs and preferences, and don't be afraid to experiment with different organizers and containers until you find the one that works best for you.

Title: Change the Season of your Closet

Change the Season of your Closet
With the official arrival of fall and the cooler days becoming the new norm, it's the perfect time to transition your closet for the season. At Chaos to Order, we highly recommend conducting a biannual closet edit to keep your wardrobe organized and functional. This process involves more than simply glancing around and deciding to keep everything. It's about carefully evaluating each clothing item in your closet.
To effectively organize your closet for the season, follow these steps:
Evaluate Each Item:Pick up each piece of clothing, one by one, and ask yourself questions like:
"Do I wear this regularly?"
"When was the last time I wore this?"
"Will I wear it during this season?"
Categorize:Sort your clothing into different piles based on your evaluation. Create categories like "keep," "donate," "give to…," and "seasonal."
Weed Out Unwanted Items:For the "donate" and "repair" categories, set aside the clothes you no longer need or those that require fixing. These can be donated to a charity or taken for repairs.
Seasonal Rotation:Since it's fall, move your spring and summer clothing to the back of the closet or to a different storage space. Bring your fall and winter clothing to the forefront for easy access.
Organize by Frequency:As you return items to your closet, arrange them based on how frequently you wear them. Place your most-used clothing at eye level for easy access. Infrequently worn items can be stored higher or lower, depending on your preference.
Consider Storage Solutions:Utilize closet storage solutions like bins, shelves, or hangers to keep things organized and easily accessible. Hanging shoe organizers, shelf dividers, and storage boxes can be very helpful.
Remove Clutter:Clear out items that don't belong in your closet. This includes non-clothing items that may have found their way in over time.
Maintenance:Regularly revisit your closet throughout the season to ensure it remains organized. If you notice items that you still haven't worn, consider moving them to the "donate" or "repair" category.
Professional Help:If you need expert assistance, don't hesitate to request an appointment with our professional organizers. They can help whip your closet into shape and provide additional tips for maintaining order.
By following these steps, you'll have a well-organized closet ready for the fall season, making it easier to find and enjoy your clothing while maintaining a clutter-free and efficient space.

Title: Organize for Fire Prevention

Organize for Fire Prevention
October is Fire Prevention Awareness month and it cannot go unsaid that it is always important to keep preventative measures in place. Check this list every October to make sure you’re safeguarded against  fire hazards in your home:
Smoke Alarms:Install smoke alarms in key areas of your home, ensuring they are in good working condition by testing them regularly. Replace batteries at least once a year.
Fire Extinguishers:Place fire extinguishers in accessible locations, particularly in the kitchen and near potential fire hazards. Ensure everyone knows how to use them.
Escape Plan:Develop a fire escape plan that includes multiple exit routes from each room. Practice this plan with all household members, especially children, to ensure everyone can evacuate quickly.
Clear Pathways:Keep hallways and exits free from clutter, making it easier to evacuate during a fire. Ensure windows can be easily opened if necessary.
Kitchen Safety:Organize the kitchen by keeping flammable items away from stovetops, using timers for cooking, and never leaving cooking unattended.
Electrical Safety:Inspect electrical outlets, cords, and appliances for damage. Avoid overloading outlets, and use surge protectors where needed.
Heating Equipment:Maintain and clean heating equipment, such as furnaces and space heaters, to prevent fires. Keep flammable materials away from all heat sources.
Candles and Open Flames:Be cautious with candles and open flames. Always extinguish candles before leaving a room.
By proactively organizing your home and family for fire prevention, you can significantly reduce the risk of fire-related incidents. Keeping things organized and regularly maintained are the keys to a safer living environment for you and your family.

Title: Organize for Fire Prevention

Organize for Fire Prevention
October is Fire Prevention Awareness month and it cannot go unsaid that it is always important to keep preventative measures in place. Check this list every October to make sure you’re safeguarded against  fire hazards in your home:
Smoke Alarms:Install smoke alarms in key areas of your home, ensuring they are in good working condition by testing them regularly. Replace batteries at least once a year.
Fire Extinguishers:Place fire extinguishers in accessible locations, particularly in the kitchen and near potential fire hazards. Ensure everyone knows how to use them.
Escape Plan:Develop a fire escape plan that includes multiple exit routes from each room. Practice this plan with all household members, especially children, to ensure everyone can evacuate quickly.
Clear Pathways:Keep hallways and exits free from clutter, making it easier to evacuate during a fire. Ensure windows can be easily opened if necessary.
Kitchen Safety:Organize the kitchen by keeping flammable items away from stovetops, using timers for cooking, and never leaving cooking unattended.
Electrical Safety:Inspect electrical outlets, cords, and appliances for damage. Avoid overloading outlets, and use surge protectors where needed.
Heating Equipment:Maintain and clean heating equipment, such as furnaces and space heaters, to prevent fires. Keep flammable materials away from all heat sources.
Candles and Open Flames:Be cautious with candles and open flames. Always extinguish candles before leaving a room.
By proactively organizing your home and family for fire prevention, you can significantly reduce the risk of fire-related incidents. Keeping things organized and regularly maintained are the keys to a safer living environment for you and your family.

Title: Basement Organization Basics

Basement Organization Basics
We often see unfinished basements used exclusively for storage, and when they are, clients are overwhelmed with the daunting project. Real estate is expensive, so why not go through those forgotten treasures, seasonal decorations, and old belongings in the basement and transform the space? Here are some ways to get there:

Start by categorizing your items into keep, donate, and discard piles. As you sift through the accumulated possessions, you might unearth forgotten items that can be repurposed or reused, saving money and reducing waste.
With a cleaner canvas to work with, consider transforming your basement into a versatile space. Depending on your needs, it could become a home gym, a hobby corner, a children's play area, or even an additional living space for gatherings.
Remember, organizing your basement isn't just about tidying up—it's about maximizing the functionality of your home and creating a space that adds value to your daily life. As the thermometer climbs, seize the opportunity to tackle this indoor project, turning your basement into a haven of order and inspiration.

Title: Head Back To School Organized

Head Back To School Organized
It’s back to school season and with the onset of school comes many changes to the schedule and routine. Here are a few tips to make for an organized transition:
First, establish a consistent routine a week or two before school starts. Adjusting sleep schedules, meal times, and study routines gradually can make the first day of school less jarring.


Effective organization is key. Help kids set up a dedicated study space that's free from distractions. Teach them to use planners or digital tools to keep track of assignments, tests, and activities, fostering time-management skills. Encourage open communication about any concerns or expectations they might have about the upcoming year.


Backpack essentials include all necessary supplies such as notebooks, pens, pencils, and a calculator. Depending on age, students might also need a laptop or tablet for digital assignments. Don't forget to pack healthy snacks and a reusable water bottle for sustained energy throughout the day.
Lastly, emphasize the importance of all around balance and organization. Remember, the back-to-school period can be both exciting and nerve-wracking for kids. Your own levels of organization along with good support and encouragement is crucial in helping kids navigate the transition successfully.

Title: Maximizing Storage Space and Simplifying Your Living Area

Maximizing Storage Space and Simplifying Your Living Area
In today's fast-paced world, maintaining an organized living space is essential for a sense of calm and efficiency. Yet, many of us fall victim to cluttered counters, overflowing tables, and random items strewn across the floor. The culprit? Underutilized storage spaces coupled with a reluctance to part with outdated belongings.
Closets, cabinets, and drawers often bear the brunt of our clutter conundrum. While these spaces hold immense potential to keep our possessions organized and out of sight, they're frequently neglected. Are you truly making the most of every inch of your storage real estate? The answer might be a resounding "no."
The solution starts with a change in mindset. Tidying up should be a continuous process, not a sporadic event. Take the extra few seconds to return items to their designated places after use. This simple practice prevents the gradual accumulation of clutter on surfaces that were meant to remain clear. By adopting a "place for everything, and everything in its place" philosophy, you'll instantly transform your living area.
Delving deeper, it's time to address the often overlooked abyss of closets, cabinets, and drawers. Regular decluttering sessions are essential to keep these spaces functional. Items that have outlived their purpose or relevance should be bid farewell. This not only frees up precious space but also allows you to focus on what truly matters.
In conclusion, the road to an organized living space requires a commitment to maximizing your storage potential and simplifying your possessions. By putting items away promptly and decluttering regularly, you can unlock the true potential of closets, cabinets, and drawers. The result? A harmonious environment that promotes productivity and peace of mind in the midst of life's chaos.

By putting items away promptly and decluttering regularly, you can unlock the true potential of closets, cabinets, and drawers. The result? A harmonious environment that promotes productivity and peace of mind in the midst of life's chaos.

Title: Maximizing Storage Space and Simplifying Your Living Area

Maximizing Storage Space and Simplifying Your Living Area
In today's fast-paced world, maintaining an organized living space is essential for a sense of calm and efficiency. Yet, many of us fall victim to cluttered counters, overflowing tables, and random items strewn across the floor. The culprit? Underutilized storage spaces coupled with a reluctance to part with outdated belongings.
Closets, cabinets, and drawers often bear the brunt of our clutter conundrum. While these spaces hold immense potential to keep our possessions organized and out of sight, they're frequently neglected. Are you truly making the most of every inch of your storage real estate? The answer might be a resounding "no."
The solution starts with a change in mindset. Tidying up should be a continuous process, not a sporadic event. Take the extra few seconds to return items to their designated places after use. This simple practice prevents the gradual accumulation of clutter on surfaces that were meant to remain clear. By adopting a "place for everything, and everything in its place" philosophy, you'll instantly transform your living area.
Delving deeper, it's time to address the often overlooked abyss of closets, cabinets, and drawers. Regular decluttering sessions are essential to keep these spaces functional. Items that have outlived their purpose or relevance should be bid farewell. This not only frees up precious space but also allows you to focus on what truly matters.
In conclusion, the road to an organized living space requires a commitment to maximizing your storage potential and simplifying your possessions. By putting items away promptly and decluttering regularly, you can unlock the true potential of closets, cabinets, and drawers. The result? A harmonious environment that promotes productivity and peace of mind in the midst of life's chaos.

What is the state of YOUR Dreamhouse?
Is your current living space your dream house? Take inspiration from the Barbie craze and evaluate the current state of your home. Does the surrounding space bring you joy? If you feel the need for improvement, consider upping the ante:
Photo from Barbie’s Malibu Dreamhouse closet on Airbnb
Reflect on your tolerance for disorganization:
Everyone has different thresholds for what they can handle. If you envision a more organized space, take frequent steps to maintain it that way. Establish routines of getting things put away promptly after use.
Set specific goals for improving your home:
No house is perfect, but setting goals and marking them on your calendar can motivate you to take action and give you deadlines. Just a 10 minute tidy can make all the difference.
Simplify your belongings:
Less clutter leads to a more organized appearance. Pay attention to the details as you whittle down your belongings. You will appreciate the results. How much do you really need?
For expert help, turn to Chaos To Order’s professional organizers:
We can assist in putting every item in its rightful place and contribute to the organization of your dream house. Give us a call and start making your dream house a reality!

Title: Car Organization to Simplify your Drive

Car Organization to Simplify your Drive
Efficiency and organization are crucial, even when on the go. Essential items like sunglasses, makeup, writing utensils, tissues, and more are often best accessible in the car rather than always carrying them around in bags or purses.
Initially, my car console was just a deep empty space, but with determination, its dimensions were measured, and a suitable organizer was sought online. I discovered a great variety ofcar console organizers available on Amazon.  What makes it even better was the ability of find organizers specific to the car’s make and model, offering gadgets and gizmos designed to enhance any car space!
I purchased this console organizer (pictured) which rests on top of a deeper space, leaving room to store other items below. This clever solution keeps everything neat and within reach while driving and at different locations.
Considering various needs, spare items like a sweater, rain jacket, throw, towel, and umbrella are thoughtfully tucked away in the car.
Preparedness extends beyond just keeping the car tidy; it involves planning ahead for future needs and potential situations.

Simple Handbag/Purse Organization Tips
Managing multiple bags for different occasions can be overwhelming and lead to chaos. To simplify your life, here are some practical tips I've employed over the years to keep track of everything you need to carry along:
Categorize and Containerize: Separate your items into distinct categories such as makeup, wallet, cords/chargers, glasses, and kid items. Use separate containers or pouches for each category. This approach enables you to easily find and access specific items without rummaging through a cluttered bag. It also streamlines the process of emptying and filling your bag since you only need to handle the containers related to your current needs.
Customize for Each Occasion:Depending on your activities, you may not require all the pouches or items in your bag at all times. Tailor your bag's contents to match the specific occasion or purpose. By keeping things organized within like items, you can quickly swap out necessary items and adapt to different situations without hassle.
Miscellaneous Items Pouch:To further enhance your organization, maintain a small pouch specifically for miscellaneous items. Opt for a compact size and include essentials like eye drops, toothbrush, floss, gum, wipes, and bandaids. This tidy pouch ensures that these miscellaneous items are easily accessible and prevents them from getting lost or tangled with other belongings.
Consider Car Storage:If you frequently use the same car, it can be beneficial to keep essential items readily available within the vehicle rather than carrying them around in your bag. This approach eliminates the need to transfer items between bags and reduces the load you have to carry. Simply identify the necessities you often require and keep them neatly stored in your car for convenience.

By implementing these practical tips, you'll streamline your handbag organization, have the flexibility to switch bags more frequently, and avoid the hassle of dealing with miscellaneous content every time you want to use a different bag.

Title: Declare Independence from your Clutter

Declare Independence from your Clutter
Feeling overwhelmed by all of your belongings? This Independence Day, liberate yourself from clutter! Here are some tips to lighten the load.
Regularly weed out.Keep a container in a frequently used area (closet), for items you want to donate or sell. Schedule regular donation pickups to maintain a steady flow of outgoing items.
Make time for decluttering.Dedicate bits of time over the long weekend to clear out a troublesome space. Prioritize this task amidst your busy schedule.
Involve the whole family.Assign tasks to each family member. While it may not be done exactly as you'd like, any progress is better than none. It's also a valuable opportunity to teach children about organizing.
Set goals and create a visual plan.Hang a chart in a prominent location and set achievable goals. Break down the steps needed to reach those goals and work on them in manageable time chunks to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
Plan a summer yard sale.If you've been postponing a yard sale, set a date as a deadline for completing projects that will support your sale.
Establish effective systems.Every item you own should have a designated place. Make the most of your tidying sessions by organizing with intention. Without proper systems, it's difficult to fully organize.
Cultivate good habits.Start now by putting away each item after use. Finish one task before starting another. Developing these habits will help you stay organized and avoid constant catch-up.

Travel Organized
If you’re planning a summer vacation, be sure to do your homework. Here are some tips to travel organized and make the most out of the journey.
Master the art of planning:
Create a detailed itinerary, research your destination and make a list of must-see places and activities. It’ll keep you organized and ensure you don’t miss out on any memorable experiences.
Pack light, pack right:
Stick to a packing list, focus on versatile clothing and use packing cubes to save space. Smart packing leads to less stress and more freedom to explore.
Embrace the digital side:
Make the most of travel apps and technology. Store your itineraries, reservations and important contacts on your phone. Offline maps and note-taking apps are your secret weapons.
Guard your documents:
Keep digital copies of important documents and carry physical copies securely. A travel wallet or hidden pocket will keep them safe. Smart document handling adds peace of mind.
Budget like a pro:
Notify your bank about your travel plans, carry multiple forms of payment, and track your expenses with apps or a travel journal. It’s the savvy way to stay on top of your finances.
With these timely tips, you’ll breeze through your travels with optimal organization. Bon voyage!

A Happy Customer’s “Life Changing” Review
We are thrilled to share a heartfelt review from one of our terrific customers. In her review, she describes her journey from overwhelming clutter to a beautifully organized closet, and how Rachel’s personalized approach and exceptional service left a lasting impact:
“Rachel organized my closet back to order! It was complete chaos with my clothing all out of sorts ~ this is my second time scheduling with Chaos to Order ~ and they really do put things in order so well that I was able to keep up with my folded clothes from the first time, and now this second time around all my hanging clothes are organized! Rachel even took a load of clothes I wanted to get rid of ~ talk about going above and beyond. All around, both experiences have been a life-changer for me with the help of the organization.”

Title: Mastering Email Organization: Strategies for an Efficient Inbox

Mastering Email Organization: Strategies for an Efficient Inbox
Organizing your email inbox can greatly improve productivity and make it easier to find important messages. Here are 5 ways to conquer email clutter:
Schedule:Set aside time to clear through your inbox, it’s a worthwhile time investment. Simply carving out 10-15 minutes will get you started.
Delete, Delete:It’s easier to eliminate email in quantity when you change the way it’s sorted. Instead of sorting by incoming date, sort by sender or subject.
Create folders or labels:Use them to categorize emails into different topics. Sorting incoming emails into relevant folders and creating a folder structure will help you locate and manage emails quickly.
Use Filters and rules:Most email platforms offer filtering or rule features that allow you to automatically sort incoming emails. Set up rules to automatically move specific emails to designated folders and they won’t even enter your inbox!
Unsubscribe:Get off lists that you’re not interested in ASAP. When you receive an unwanted email, scroll to the bottom and unsubscribe.
Remember, the effectiveness of these methods depends on your personal preferences and work style. Experiment with different approaches to find the one that suits you best.

Title: Mastering Email Organization: Strategies for an Efficient Inbox

Mastering Email Organization: Strategies for an Efficient Inbox
Organizing your email inbox can greatly improve productivity and make it easier to find important messages. Here are 5 ways to conquer email clutter:
Schedule:Set aside time to clear through your inbox, it’s a worthwhile time investment. Simply carving out 10-15 minutes will get you started.
Delete, Delete:It’s easier to eliminate email in quantity when you change the way it’s sorted. Instead of sorting by incoming date, sort by sender or subject.
Create folders or labels:Use them to categorize emails into different topics. Sorting incoming emails into relevant folders and creating a folder structure will help you locate and manage emails quickly.
Use Filters and rules:Most email platforms offer filtering or rule features that allow you to automatically sort incoming emails. Set up rules to automatically move specific emails to designated folders and they won’t even enter your inbox!
Unsubscribe:Get off lists that you’re not interested in ASAP. When you receive an unwanted email, scroll to the bottom and unsubscribe.
Remember, the effectiveness of these methods depends on your personal preferences and work style. Experiment with different approaches to find the one that suits you best.

Title: Organize Your Closet

Organize Your Closet
Keeping your closet organized saves time (by being able to grab what you need quickly when you need it) and also saves money (by knowing exactly what you have so not to over purchase). If your closet feels too cluttered or less than optimally organized, here are some tips to organize it into shape:
Weed Out/Purge
If you didn't wear it last season, it's time to let it go. Go through each and every item. This will not only help to know where things are, it will also give a good mental inventory of what you currently have.
Like Items Together
Get T-shirts, pants, dresses, sweaters, etc...together. Having a place for every little thing, and a specific place to always return to is the key to keeping your closet optimally organized.
Hanger Harmony
Changing the hangers so they are all the same creates a much more organized looking closet. Also, eliminating unused hangers will help free up much needed space. Here's our favoritebasic hanger.
Seasonal Storage
Not enough space? Consider removing off-season clothes if you're feeling too tight in the current space. Here are some tips forseasonal storage.
Structured Systems
If you really need an overhaul, it might be a good time to consider upgrading to a custom closet system. Having shelving, drawers, double hanging and adjustability truly helps maximize the space.
Color Coordinate
For extra organization, try hanging clothes by color to find items even quicker. Here are more tips onorganizing your clothes by color.

Title: Get The Garage Organized

Get The Garage Organized
If you haven’t done it yet, now is the perfect time to get out in the garage and give it a good spring clean!  Remember, organizing is all about eliminating what you no longer need and finding good, efficient places for what is used frequently.
According to a survey by the US Department of Energy, 25% of people with two-car garages don’t park any cars in them, and 32% only have room for one car!  All of that random garage stuff requires time and attention to sort through. It’s never going to go away on its own. You have to spend time determining what to keep and what to toss. Of course, Chaos To Order organizers are experts at this and will guide you through the process to get your garage optimally organized in a timely manner.
Dividing the garage storage space into zones can be a helpful way for getting and keeping things organized. Here are some examples:
kids items, toys, bikes
sports equipment, balls, golf…
Auto cleaning/repair
Yard/garden tools, pots…
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t stand back and look at the whole garage. Start in one spot and make decisions on each and every item. Once you’ve gone through the entire space and have eliminated what can go, then create the zones, consider storage bins/shelving options and get everything properly placed.
If you could use an expert coach through the process, our professional organizers at Chaos To Order are happy to help, just remember to schedule well in advance because they’re in demand.

Title: Stay Organized When Working From Home

Stay Organized When Working From Home
More people are working from home than ever before. It certainly has its benefits, however, keeping work and home related matters separate has gotten more complicated. It’s important to stay organized on both fronts. Here are some tips for staying on top of it all:
Utilize Your Calendar:Scheduling time, including meetings, projects, personal time, and even downtime, is the best way to make the most of every day. Whether paper or digital, keeping it all on a calendar that is handy and optimally used is important. Digital calendars allow you to share with other family members and can help keep track of everyone’s schedules.
Create a Routine:We all do better with a routine in place. Look at your day and take notice of patterns, and do what you can to establish clear daily/weekly habits. Anything you can do on a regular, consistent basis will help create patterns to promote success.
Purge What You Can:Clutter can accumulate even faster when you're spending more time at home. Keep a donation bag/box handy. Need to take a 15 min break from work? Use that time to edit—when in doubt, toss it out!
Plan Ahead:Planning in advance will help you get through busy times more efficiently. Think about the coming months now. Summertime is around the corner, schedules will change, new activities are coming. Do do what you can to optimize your summer.
Chaos To Order Can Help:Our expert organizers can help with everything from getting the WFH office organized to complete move coordination. We organize of any room from attic to basement.
