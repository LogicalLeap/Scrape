Title: 10 Types of Videos that Attract More YouTube Watch Time

10 Types of Videos that Attract More YouTube Watch Time
Even as a small creator, there's a good chance you've seen all the tips and tricks forearning more watch time on YouTube. So today, we're sharing a different perspective. Instead of telling you how to build watch more hours, we're going to reveal the types of videos that get watchedlonger.
Why does this matter? We know most creators want to reach 3,000-4,000 hours of watch time on their channels. Achieving this milestone puts you in the running to join theYouTube Partner Programand make money from your content. After all, who doesn't want some extra cash on the side?
These 10, highly-watched videos will help you do just that!

1. Podcast Episodes
Podcasts are the unsung heroes of YouTube. They're mostly listened to rather than viewed, which means you don't have to worry about keeping viewers' attentionvisually. If the topic is interesting and the conversation flows, podcasting is a powerful way to rack up those watch time minutes.
Plus, YouTube is the number one place to listen to podcasts, according to aLuminate surveyof 3,000 U.S. listeners. The same report lists true crime, comedy, news, and politics as the top genres. Perhaps that's why theJoe Rogan Experience,a leading show, has been popular for so long; it explores a mix of topics and interests!
2. Children's Content
Kids can't get enough of YouTube, and they're known for watching videos on repeat. Whether it's nursery rhymes or educational content, children's videos are a goldmine for collecting YouTube watch hours.
Need an example of just how dominant a kids channel can be? Look no further the viral song, "Baby Shark" by Pinkfong. It's the most-watched video in YouTube history, and it's the first video to hit10 billion views. That's a lot of watch time!
3. "How-To" Guides and Tutorials
"How-to" videos aim to guide viewers through a process, so they can potentially gain higher watch time on YouTube.
But many minutes and hours can one expect in the education space? That depends on what you're teaching andhow complex it is.
For example, a how-to guide on making friends is useful, but whether you need avideofor that is debatable. Technically, you could read a short article and get all the information you need.
Fixing a car engine is more complex and time consuming. That might require a visual guide, written instructions,andaudio cues to make the task a bit easier. So, starting a how-to channel is smart if you're teaching something few people understand!
4. Comedy Skits
YouTube pranks, parodies, and goofy skits have a lot going for themselves. They keep viewers engaged and watching until the end, which is the best way to stack more watch hours. Plus, comedic videos are relatable enough to get shared across internet and evengo viral. This is especially true if the punchline is worth the wait and there's a storyline to follow.
And besides, who doesn't love a good laugh? Google lists comedy as one of thetop four categories watchedalongside music videos, how-to content, and pop culture. Check outGen-Z Hospital, a skit fromSaturday Night Live,to see what people love about this genre.
5. Music Meme Videos
Music videos (or even audio tracks) collect a lot of watch time on YouTube, especially if they're catchy. Just think of all the "internet songs" inspired by viral memes. Some are still gettingthousands of playstoday and building extra watch time by the minute!
For example, have you listened to the meme-ified songIt's Corn!by Songify This, Tariq, and Recess Therapy? The YouTube video has 34 million views and counting, which is impressive for just one year of viewership. The trend may die, but the song lives on forever!
So, here's the real question: Are you musically inclined? Use your talents to songify a meme, and you might get more watch time!
6. Long-Form Documentaries
Documentaries explore one topic topic in depth through a mix of education, entertainment, and sometimesshock value.So, don't think of them as long, boring YouTube videos. If there's some controversy or tension driving the story forward, you have the perfect recipe for keeping viewers' attention.
Need some inspiration? Check outThe Genius Within: Extraordinary Gifted Peopleby Real Stories.
7. Livestreams
Live content allows for real-time interaction between creators and their viewers. These broadcastsaren'tshort, either; many streams will range from a few minutes to12 hours maximumon YouTube. Considering that, it's no wonder streaming pulls in so much watch time!Not only that, it's easy to convert livestreams to regular YouTube content when the broadcast is over. So you'll gain watch hours during the livestreamand after!
One example is the rise of Fortnite livestreams. They're popular, engaging, and lengthy, all of which leads to more viewing minutes.
8. ASMR Videos
ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response. It refers to the tingling sensation running from scalp to spine that a listener feels in response to soothing noises.
But are thererealASMR videos on YouTube? We'll never know for sure. What wedo knowis that videos with great audio get tons of watch time on YouTube.
Like podcasts, viewers don't have to see the screen to enjoy ASMR. It's an auditory experience, so they're listening to rain sounds, gentle wind, cooking noises, and more. Check out this ASMR cooking video from Men With The Pot to see what we mean!
9. Gaming Videos
Gaming is fun, but it's alsotask oriented.Viewers are there to see someone beat a tricky level, build something complicated, explore glitches in a game, and countless other quests. They're learning something new while also being entertained, and that's a sure-fire way to get anyone's attention!

10. Compilation Videos
Compilation videos offer a variety of content in one package, keeping viewers engaged for a long time. Best of all, there's a compilation video for almost anything you can think of — funny pet moments, gaming fails, spooky pranks,  silly bloopers, and more. The more entertaining the content, the more watch time you can earn!

YouTube Watch Time: 9 Ways to Reach 4,000 Hours and Monetize Your Channel
If you're reading this, you probably know that getting4,000 watch hoursis a critical checkpoint on the road to YouTube monetization. It's not easy, and many creators spend a year or more getting there, but it's ultimately worth it. Achieving this goal means you can monetize your videos with advertisements through theYouTube Partner Program, which is a lot likemaking money in your sleep. It's a hands-off way to boost your income!
Understanding Watch Time on YouTube
But first, what is watch time, and how is it calculated on YouTube?
For your watch time to count toward monetization, you must gain 4,000 viewing hours in 12 consecutive months. The videos don't have to be published in the last 12 months, as long as viewers watched them over the previous year.

Also, only certain types of videos can collect watch time. Make sure you're getting 4,000publicwatch hours, as this is the main qualifier — so don't set your videos to private!

Do You Need 4,000 Hours to Join the YPP?
Notably, you don't need 4,000 hours to get into the YPP.You can do that with just 3,000 hoursand then monetize your videos through fan funding instead of ads. These include Super Chats, Super Thanks, channel memberships, and more. Below are the minimum requirements to join the YPP, but remember thatyou'll still need 4,000 hours to earn ad revenue.

Finding Your Channel's Watch Time
So, how many watch hours have you collected so far? Knowing this number is extremely helpful, especially when building a strategy to keep viewers' attention.
1. Go to the YouTube Studio and clickEarnin the left navigation bar.
2. On the Become a Partner page, scroll down toHow to Join. And there, you'll see how much watch time your channel has.
How to Get More Watch Time on YouTube: 9 Powerful Tips
Now that you know where you stand, use these powerful tips to increase your watch time on YouTube.
1. Master the Art of YouTube Storytelling
Telling a good storyis crucial for keeping viewers engaged, and thus, boosting your watch hours on YouTube. In every video, you want to grab viewers' attention, take them on a journey, and create emotional scenes that hook them along the way.
To do this effectively, master three areas of YouTube storytelling:
Titles and Thumbnails
Your title and thumbnail are like two sides of the same coin. They should give viewers a snapshot of what the video is about and communicate how it willfeelto watch it. For example, notice how the creator's dread in this thumbnail reinforces the video's title: "Big Mistakes Small YouTubers Still Make."
Video Introductions
The best introductionsget straight to the point by mentioning what viewers care about in the first three seconds. If you're struggling tocome up with hooks, study the best–performing YouTube Shorts and the introductions they have. Introductory phrases like "They don't want you to know this secret" or "I never do this, and here's why" are effective curiosity drivers.
Emotional Triggers
Emotion makes your content 10 times more relatable. Try usingemotional triggerslike fear, nostalgia, novelty, and scarcity to make your videos seem urgent and relevant to the viewer's life.
2. Increase Engagement with Pattern Interrupters
A good story may pique viewers' interest, but knowing how to edit that story is the real watch-time booster.
Pattern interruptersare your secret weapon for this. They turn a good video into a great one by adding variety to what's already there. On YouTube, a pattern interrupter is any visual or auditory element that changes someone's thought pattern.I should leave this videois one thought you want to interrupt in a viewer's mind!
Some examples of pattern interrupts include:
3. Use Captions Throughout Your Videos
Getting someone to watch your video for longer is much easierwhen captions are present. Think about it: "Reading along" takes pressure off of viewers who don't want to listen to a video or have some degree of hearing loss. Plus, viewers in crowded, noisy areas benefit from reading captions versus listening to audio.
Additionally, subtitles should be your go-to if you have a multicultural audience on YouTube. They translate your audio into multiple languages so people in faraway regions understand you better!
4. Skip the Basic Outro
Filming a long outro feels natural, but did you know there are better ways to close out a video? Most viewers click away when they hear goodbye phrases, such as:
Instead of announcing the end of a video, leave before anyone knows what's happening. Your watch time will improve when you don't signal that a video is ending.
5. Make Evergreen YouTube Videos
Evergreen content is popular year-round, so you need those types of videos to get watch time fast. Evergreen topics like how to change careers, how to cook brown rice, and tips for making friends in your 30s have a high search volume from January to December.
As you can see, many evergreen videos aresearch-basedand offer steady watch time through sheer popularity.
If you're struggling to find evergreen video ideas, ask yourself a question:
For example, vidIQ subscribers love to hear growth tips for small channels. One of our videos on the subject has over 78,000 watch hours since it was published six months ago. And the hours arestill increasing!
6. Host YouTube Live Streams
Watch time from streaming will always count toward your 4,000-hour goal, so bond with viewers in real-time. It's the perfect way torack up those monetization hours!
When we started our live stream journey, 50-100 people showed up. Now we get hundreds of concurrent viewers, and with that boost in viewership comes plenty of additional watch time.
For example, check out the watch time from this two-hour live stream:
Give streaming a chance when you have about 12 months of YouTube experience. By then you should have 100 or more subscribers who may show up to watch your streams.
7. Build Watch Time Through Playlists
Why do people binge videos for hours on Netflix? Simply put, it's because their shows are organized with the help ofplaylists. Viewers don't have to keep selecting episodes when they want to watch a romantic comedy or learn about nature through a documentary. They click on a show, and Netflix plays the episodes automatically.
This is an excellent strategy to bring to your YouTube channel. Figure out which topics viewers care about the most, then create YouTube playlists that hold 10 or more videos. It's one of the easiest ways to increase your watch hours!

8. Use End Screens to Build Watch Time
YouTube end screens are interactive outros that appear in the last 5-20 seconds of a video. You can add all sorts of clickable elements to them, such as website links, a subscribe button, or even a YouTube channel you want to promote. But it's wise to "send" viewers to the rest of your content if you want more watch hours.
So, instead of creating an "outro," make your last point, then quickly transition to an end screen. Now you can recommend one more video to viewers!

9. Upload Videos Consistently
YouTube's recommendation system has one job, but it's a pretty big one. It has to suggest the right content to viewers based on their watch history and other factors.
YouTube can do this faster and easier if you're always making videos. After all, how can the algorithm rely on any channel for quality recommendations if there isn't much content?
You don't have to upload every day, but stick to a schedule that keeps viewers engaged and doesn't burn you out.

FAQ: More Details About YouTube Watch Time
Can I watch my own YouTube videos for more watch time?
You can press play on your own videos, but doing so to increase your watch time isn’t a good idea. According toYouTube’s Fake Engagement Policy, the platform “doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics.” Plus, many creators have found thatYouTube deletes viewscoming from their own browser after 48 hours.
Do YouTube Shorts count as watch time?
Unfortunately, watch time from Shorts does not count toward the 4,000 hours you need to join the YouTube Partner Program. Those hours must come from regular videos. An alternative route is getting 1,000 subscribers plus10 million public Shorts views in 90 days.
Should I buy YouTube watch time hours?
You should never buy YouTube watch time if you want to keep your channel in good standing. Instead, focus on making high-quality videos that bring viewers in naturally. After all, purchasing fake engagement could lead to strikes against your channel, a suspended account, or channel termination.
Should I make longer videos to get more watch time?
Don't make long videos just to reach 4,000 hours.You should make your videos just long enough to cover a specific topic. When viewers get bored and abandon a video, that hurts your watch time.
What's an underrated way to increase my watch time?
Become obsessed with audience retention.The longer people watch your videos, the more watch time you'll receive. How many people are still watching after the 30-second mark? Are viewers watching until the end, or do they watch 50% of a video on average? These are questions you should ask to create better content.
Reach Your Watch Time Goals on YouTube

Title: YouTube Algorithm Hack: Chase Watch Time and Engagement — Not Views

YouTube Algorithm Hack: Chase Watch Time and Engagement — Not Views
As the YouTube algorithm evolves, creators learn to prioritize different metrics on their channels. They might be interested in views, click-through rate, subscribers gained, and other markers of success. But did you know that the most obvious one, YouTube views,is notthe best catalyst for growth? In 2023, watch time and viewer satisfaction (also known as engagement) are clearly in the lead.
The truth is that it's hard to get more views without first satisfying your audience and making them watch longer. Only then does the YouTube algorithm recommend your content to more people!
Read More:Understanding the YouTube Algorithm in 2023

But, how do you strike the perfect balance between keeping your audience glued to the screen and ensuring they walk away fulfilled? Let's break it down.
Watch Time
Watch Time is often considered the holy grail of YouTube metrics.It indicates how long viewers stay on a platform and can impact a channel's ability to rank and gain suggested views. In many cases, watch time on YouTube is more important than the average viewer retention rate.
Of course, it is one of the essential factors for getting monetized, and for good reason. A high watch time for your channel would typically mean that viewers like to binge on your content and that’s one of the best signals to the algorithm!
Viewer Satisfaction
YouTube has been increasingly focusing on viewer satisfaction, which encompasses likes, comments, and overall engagement. With the help of these indicators, the recommendation system on YouTube learns how to serve the viewer the best possible video every time.
More recently, YouTube has also used surveys to ask the viewers directly about their experience on the platform, which makes the viewers feel more included in the platform. The positive response has prompted YouTube to make viewer satisfaction the central aspect of the new and improved algorithm.

Is Watch Time Better Than Views?
Ah, the age-old question. While views give you an overview of your content's reach, watch time offers a deeper look into viewer engagement. A video with fewer views but higher watch time often indicates content that resonates more deeply with your audience. So, if you're looking to build a loyal community around your channel,watch time should be your go-to metric.
Striking the Balance
Striking a balance between watch time and viewer satisfaction is essential for long-term success on YouTube. While watch time can help you climb the algorithmic ladder, focusing solely on it can lead to short-term gains. On the other hand, viewer satisfaction is about building a lasting relationship with your audience, which is invaluable for any creator.
In this video byCreator Insider, Todd Beaupre, who leads YouTube's growth and discovery team, emphasizes focusing on long-term satisfaction rather than just maximizing watch time. Todd advises creators to think about what their audience wants and find the best fit, as the algorithm will then match that.
So how do you balance watch time with viewer satisfaction? Here are some tips:
1. Go for Quality Over Quantity
In the age of pumping out content with AI, this advice seems counter-intuitive. But, instead of focusing solely on watch time, aim for content that provides real value. Whether it's a how-to guide or an in-depth review, make sure your videos offer something meaningful.
When viewers find value in your content, they're more likely to engage with it, binge it, share it, and discuss it with others. And soon enough, enable you tofoster a sense of community within them!
2. Make Engaging Videos
To boost your watch hoursandsatisfy viewers, make your content engaging from start to finish. Usestorytelling techniques,high-quality B-rolls, and even interactive elements like polls to keep your audience invested.
3. Monitor Viewer Feedback
Always keep an eye on the comments section and any feedback you receive through social media or direct messages. This real-time feedback is gold when it comes to gauging viewer satisfaction. It's also a good way to spot new video ideas!
Read More:How to Get Subscriber Feedback from a YouTube Analytics Deep Dive
4. Experiment and Analyze
Don't be afraid to experiment with different video formats and lengths.Use YouTube Analyticsto track how these changes affect both watch time and viewer satisfaction.
The YouTube algorithm is a complex beast that creators often find themselves trying to tame. It helps to keep an eye on your analytics to understand what's working and what needs improvement and act upon it.
Watch Time and Viewer Satisfaction Go Hand-in-Hand
If you satisfy viewers with the right content, you’ll see results in the form of an improved retention rate, higher returning viewers, and hopefully, more watch time! The key takeaway is to find the right balance.
So, go ahead and experiment, analyze, and most importantly, create content that you're passionate about. The numbers will follow. If you're a small creator looking to improve,then check out these quick fixes!

YouTube Monetization: Which Videos Count Toward 4,000 Hours of Watch Time?
Earning 4,000 hours of Watch Time is the dream for most creators, but it isn’t easy. Gaining 100 hours, sure. But thousands? That’ll test your determination to keep going on YouTube. Essentially, you have to post multiple videos and hope people watch them for long enough.
But once you have 4,000 hours, everything gets easier. You’ll be one step closer to applying to the YouTube Partner Program, which lets you monetize your channel with advertisements. Having those valuable hours allows you to focus on other things, too, likegetting 1,000 subscribers. That’s the second  requirement for earning ad revenue.
Read More:YouTube Partner Program – How to Monetize Your Channel

When you’re collecting watch time hours, it’s easy to overlook certain parts of the process. The biggest, most understated part, is thatnot all watch hours counttoward the YPP threshold.
These 5 Videos Aren’t Eligible for YPP Watch Time
Before you start earning watch time, know which videos are in your best interest to create. There are five videos that make it hard — in most cases, impossible — to reach 4,000 hours.
1. Videos Set to Private or Unlisted
Years ago, private and unlisted videos counted toward YPP watch time.That changed in 2019when YouTube decided that public videos, not partially viewable content, could accumulate watch hours.
This means you need toprioritize public videos over private or unlisted ones.Unlisted videos can only be watched if certain people have the link. This privacy option benefits creators with specific content plans. They may want to send videos to friends and family or create a webinar for a limited audience.
But if you’re trying to monetize your channel, unlisted and private videos aren’t helpful. Make sure videos that need to be public are, in fact, set to public. That’ll help you reach 4,000 hours and apply to the YPP.
How to set private or unlisted videos to public on YouTube
1. Go to theYouTube Studio.
2. ClickContenton the left navigation menu.
3. Find the video you want to make public, then go to theVisibilitycolumn. Click the eyeball symbol to reveal a menu of options: private, unlisted, members only, and public. ChoosePublic,and then clickPublish.
2. Videos You’ve Deleted
When you delete content,YouTube deducts the watch timefrom your total count. For example, imagine your channel has 2,000 watch hours. If you delete a video that contributed 500 of those hours, you’ll be left with 1,500. Before you delete anything, check to see how many watch hours your content has earned.
Sometimes deleting a video is inevitable. Maybe you’ve grown as a person since it was first published and want to clean up your image. Or perhaps someone appeared in your video without prior consent, and they want you to take it down. Whatever the reason, make sure it’s worth deleting a video and losing precious watch hours.
3. Advertising Campaigns
Have you created video ads for YouTube? If you were hoping these would help you apply to the YPP, unfortunately, they won’t. Watch hours from advertising campaigns don’t count toward YouTube monetization. Even if you’ve earned 10,000 hours, none of it will go toward the 4,000 hours you need.
This seems fair because ads can get millions of views. If YouTube counts them for YPP acceptance, that’ll create a shortcut to monetization.
4. YouTube Shorts
Watch time from Shortsdoes notcontribute to a creator’s 4,000-hour goal, so rely on long-form videos when you're racking up those hours!
5. Unconverted Live Streams
Live streams are a great way to increase your watch time. These videos are usually lengthy, and if people stick around until the end, you can add several hours to your overall count.
According to YouTube, live streams that aren’t converted to video-on-demand content won’t earn YPP watch hours. The information around this is pretty vague, so we'd suggest making sure your live streams are public when they've ended. Don't archive a live stream by setting it to unlisted or private.
Just to be sure, we asked YouTube if this advice made sense for creators.
We didn't get a straightforward answer, but creators chimed in with their personal experience. A few of them said they earn watch time both during and after a live stream, which includes video-on-demand viewing.
Whether these hours were recorded for YPP watch time is another story. That's why, as soon as possible, we'd recommend checking to see if your live stream is public after it ends. If it's unlisted or private, switch it to public.
How to Get 4,000 Hours of YouTube Watch Time
To reach 4,000 hours of watch time, create a diverse set of content. Be intentional with the videos you upload, and go for quality over quantity. Once you've covered those areas, the six tips above will help you maximize your watch hours.

Title: The Art of YouTube Storytelling: A Secret Path to More Watch Time

The Art of YouTube Storytelling: A Secret Path to More Watch Time
If you want people to listen, tell them a story. That much has always been clear, from the early days of hieroglyphics to the rise of books, movies, and TV.
Today, it seems like YouTube is the best place to share those real, authentic stories — and for good reason. YouTube viewers watch overa billion hours of videoeach day. To meet this demand, creators are posting over 500 hours of contentper minute.
In other words, the competition is heating up! With so many storytellers on YouTube, it takes more than fancy equipment, the right keywords, and a juicy title to get more watch time. For that, you need tomasterYouTube storytelling.

The Science of Attention
Did you know most people stop watching a YouTube video after 30 seconds? If you looked at the audience retention graph for that content, you would see something like this:
So what does it take to keep viewers engaged?
According to aUniversity of Chicagostudy, it’s all about emotion. Viewers pay attention when you make them feel something or change their emotional state, especially when watching movies. Their brains “light up” because they're engrossed in what's happening, be it a sad, happy, or shocking scene.
If you want to do this on YouTube, study the movies and TV shows that hold  your attention. Look at how those stories are structured so you can use the same format on YouTube.
A Storytelling Format that Gets More Watch Time
Now that you know emotional content makes people listen, how do you pump those moments into your videos?
One solution is to use thehero’s journey,a common plot device inHarry Potter,Star Wars, and hundreds of other movies. It focuses on a single protagonist, an adventure they take, and what they learn along the way.
Here’s what the hero's journey looks like:
With this plot device, you can explore concepts like fear, loss, growth, and triumph — which is why it works! Each chapter sparks a new emotion in the protagonistandthe viewer. Thanks to a powerful insight (emotion = attention), we know this plot device canboost YouTube watch time.
YouTube Examples of the Hero’s Journey
You can use the hero’s journey in almost any video, but it works best in challenge or storytime content.
So as a quick example, we’ll share two videos from those categories. You'll see how both stories follow the hero's journey, even if the creators tweaked them a bit for YouTube.
It's also worth mentioning that these videos got massive views. So there's a good chance they had lots of watch time, which prompted theYouTube algorithmto share them with more people.
Ryan Trahan: “I Spent 100 Days in Pokémon”
Ryan Trahanis known for his legendary challenges, including one where he useda single pennyto cross North America. In the video below (1 million+ views), he uses the hero’s journey for a gaming challenge.

3:10–19:00: Ryan faces battles, missions, and side quests. He loses several Pokémon along the way but defeats every gym leader by day 81!
Approach to the Inmost Cave
23:08–23:45: Ryan loses “QuackBoom,” a strong Pokemon that brought him super far in the game. It’s a sad loss! (RIP QuackBoom)

The Ordeal
31:07–33:00: Ryan defeats the champion of all champions in the Pokémon league. He gives an emotional speech about what's he’s learned while playing Pokémon over the years.
Lynette Adkins: “I Had to Reprogram My Mind to Create My Dream Life”
Lynette Adkinsis a lifestyle creator who talks about navigating life and evolving your mindset. In the video below (336,000+ views), she shares a major life update using the hero’s journey.

A Compelling Story = YouTube Views
To master YouTube storytelling, you must look outside of YouTube. Study the classics that laid the foundation for every plot device we know today.The Lion King.Gone with the Wind.Jaws. Then you can use those stories as a blueprint to make emotional, captivating content. That's how you get more watch time on YouTube!
But if you need more advice, here are 5 more ways to keep viewers entertained.

Title: 5 Ways to Increase YouTube Watch Time on Any Video

5 Ways to Increase YouTube Watch Time on Any Video
Do your YouTube videos earn enough watch time? It's not an easy question to answer, but it's one you should ask often.
After all,watch time is important on YouTube. It represents the total amount of time people spend watching your videos, so it's in your best interest to increase that number. The more watch time you have, the easier it is to monetize your channel and get more video views.
For example, you need4,000 hours of watch timeto qualify for the YouTube Partner Program (along with 1,000 subscribers). Once you're in, you can make money through video advertisements and hopefully earn a full-time income.

Plus, videos with high watch time – among other things – send a positive signal to YouTube's algorithm. So as you improve that metric, YouTube mightrecommend your videos to more viewers.
But if you're struggling to get YouTube watch hours, don't worry. Here's how to increase the amount of time people spend watching your videos.
1. Start with an Attractive Title and Thumbnail
Imagine what it's like to browse the YouTube homepage. There are dozens of videos to look at, with bold, colorful thumbnails. If you want to earn any watch time to begin with, you need a graphic that stands out and encourages viewers to click.
Read More:YouTube Thumbnail Guide: 9 Ways to Boost Click-Through Rate
Take a look at the vidIQ thumbnail below. It's paired with one of our popular videos, "How To Check Who Has Subscribed to Your YouTube Channel (New Method)."
Viewers responded so well to this thumbnail that the video has:
In other words, 15% of people who saw the thumbnail decided to click on the video – which is pretty good! And once viewers clicked, we gave them a fantastic video that has collected15,000 watch hoursso far.
Thumbnails pop out at viewers first, but titles play a role too. Make sure yours are better than the standard YouTube title, which has relevant keywords and a clear topic.The best video titleshave all of that, plus a mysterious aura that whispers, "Click me."
2. Create a Video 'Hook'
Your video needs more than a basic introduction if you want to increase your watch hours. It's best to create ahookthat reels viewers in and keeps them watching past the 30-second mark, where most people click away.
To see what we mean, go to your YouTube analytics and look at theaudience retentionon some of your content.
You can get there by going tostudio.youtube.comand clickingAnalyticsin the left navigation bar.
Scroll down to the section labeledYour top content this period.
Finally, click on any video and scroll down toKey moments for audience retention.
Take a look at the audience retention graph for the video you selected. More than likely, it has a line trending downward after 30 seconds. That line is shaped like a hockey stick, and the first "bend" is where people stopped watching your video.
The right video hook should do four things to combat this:
Need an example? The video below checks all four boxes. The hook is only 20 seconds long, and Rob Wilson (our expert YouTuber) is having fun. He's teasing valuable parts of the video, being playful, and making us chuckle at a few memes.
Thanks to our hook, 71% of viewers were still watching at the 30-second mark. That's better than our typical performance.
Over time, little victories like these increase your watch hours on YouTube.
3. Use Jump Cuts to Quicken the Pace
Have you ever watched a YouTube video with long, never-ending scenes? How did it make you feel inside?
If words like "bored" or "disinterested" come to mind, you can guarantee your viewers feel the same way. No one wants to see the same thing for several minutes, especially if nothing new pops onto the screen. That's the fastest way to kill your watch time as people exit the video.
The solution? Use the almighty jump cut. It's a video editing technique that breaks longer scenes into two or more clips toreduce viewer fatigue.
Watch the video below to see howMrBeast, arguably the best YouTuber ever, does it. He's the jump-cut king, so there's never a dull moment in his videos.
4. Add Visual and Auditory Breaks
As mentioned before, hundreds of people leave videos at the 30-second mark. They either get bored, look for better videos, or leave to do non-YouTube-related things. It's normal and to be expected.
But if you want to squeeze in some extra watch time, placepattern interruptersin your content. Apattern interruptis anything that changes a person's behavior or thinking process for a short while. On YouTube, the best pattern interrupters stop viewers from thinking, "I should leave this video."
If your content has any of these elements, you're already using pattern interrupters:
These elements break up the monotony of previous scenes, so viewers stay engaged.
5. Don't Announce the End of a Video – Just Leave
This might be an unpopular opinion, but most videos don't need outros. If the viewer already got what they came for – entertainment, instruction, etc. – there's no incentive to keep watching beyond that.
So instead of doing an outro, just end the video without warning. Otherwise, people will look for the X button when you say things like, "That's about it" and "Those are all of my tips."
And when they leave, they'll take extra watch time with them.

How to Increase Audience Retention on Every YouTube Video
JUMP TO SECTION:
Are viewers watching your YouTube videos to completion? Is your audience retention so high that 70% of people are still watching after the first 30 seconds?
If not, you have an opportunity to improve the "stickiness" of your videos. This is a special kind of video magic that stops people from clicking away. Creating sticky videos is about identifying what’s working (or not) to keep viewers engaged.

This simple act will help you flourish on YouTube. The algorithm loves topromote highly-watched videospeople seem to enjoy. Plus, you canmake more money from AdSenseas your Watch Time increases.
Read More:YouTube Watch Time - The Secret Sauce to More YouTube Views and Subscribers
The first step is understanding how audience retention works. Keep reading to discover this metric on your own channel, plus six simple ways to keep people watching.
What Is Audience Retention on YouTube?
On your channel,audience retentionshows how many viewers are watching a video throughout the beginning, middle, end, or altogether. The "altogether" rate is shown as a percentage of total views. So for example, if you post a 12-minute video, and people watch for eight minutes on average, your audience retention rate is 66%.
In the YouTube Studio, you’ll see different moments within a video that affect your audience retention, such as:
These moments highlight where viewers are losing or gaining interest during a video.
Take a look at the image below from YouTube’ssupport pageto see what each moment looks like on an audience retention graph.
In addition to these moments,average view durationis a key retention metric. It’s an estimate of how many minutes viewers watched a video, on average. Increasing this number, as well as other retention metrics, can boost your views on YouTube.
How to See Your Channel’s Audience Retention
Want to see if your videos are truly engaging? Follow the steps below to find out.
Here’s what the graph looks like:
This data is from a video of ours, titled “YouTube’s Discovery Algorithm...Exposed.” The audience retention graph shows that:
Also, don't forget to check out yourtypical retention, a new YouTube metric. It compares videos of similar length on your channel and tells you if the video you're analyzing is performing better or worse than previous content.
Audience retention varies widely. It can change depending on the length of your video, the topic, and the audience. For example, a gaming or education channel’s retention could be low because ofwhois watching andwhy.Young children are intrigued by gaming videos, but they have short attention spans. An adult who watches a video about investing may skip certain parts to find one piece of information. There are many reasons people don’t finish a video, so take your niche, as well as audience behavior, into consideration.
What Is a Good Audience Retention Rate on YouTube?
First, know that there isn’t a golden percentage for audience retention. Viewers have different intentions for watching a video, which leads to shorter or longer Watch Time. That’s not a bad thing at all. It leaves you free to analyze your data and make adjustments without comparing yourself to others.
But if you need a benchmark, our YouTuber-in-residence Rob Wilson has a number in mind.

How to Double Your YouTube Watch Time by Looping Shorts


What’s your average view duration on YouTube? For every video you post, do people watch to the end or leave midway?

To us, a 50% duration is phenomenal. It’s hard to get viewers to go any further than that. Meeting or even crossing the 50% threshold means you’re doing something right on YouTube.
If you’re not there yet, don’t worry. We have two suggestions to increase your average view duration:
Shorts, which are vertical videos of less than a minute, are capable of holding viewers’ attention. It’s easy to finish a video that’s only 20 or 30 seconds long.

That creates a huge opportunity for you. By posting quality Shorts, you can get close to a 100% view duration, on average. This helps you penetrate the YouTube algorithm, which suggests videos with a high Watch Time to viewers. And if youcreate Shorts that loop– videos that have no discernable end or beginning – you can convince someone to watch twice, which doubles your Watch Time.

That’s what animatorJake Fellmanaccomplished on hisShorts channelof 4.9 million subscribers. Viewers used to watch nearly 100% of his content. That percentage climbed to almost 200% when he started looping his 3D Minecraft Shorts. Without realizing it, viewers were watching each video twice.
The screenshot below shows Fellman's average view duration, which doubled from January to April.

Here’s how Fellman looped his Shorts to earn more Watch Time.
The Video ‘Loop’ Concept
Fellman is used to getting several million views on a Short. He’s been doing that for months now, so the numbers have to change drastically for him to take notice.
One day, he posted a Short of a skeleton getting shot with a red arrow. It performed so much better than his previous videos, even though they had millions of views. So he decided to investigate.
The looped arrowhead video is titled “Minecraft RTX 24% Arrowhead Loop.” Press play below to view the Short, which seems to have no beginning or end:
YouTube has a built-in loop function for Shorts. If the viewer doesn’t swipe to the next video, the same Short plays again. When the replay creates a perfect loop, someone can mistakenly watch a video twice – maybe three times – before realizing the video is over. That’s when the Watch Time soars above 100%.
How to Create Shorts That Loop
Want to increase your Watch Time? Do these three things to make Shorts that seemingly play forever.
YouTube Wants You to Loop Your Shorts
Looping a Short to get more Watch Time feels like a grimy hack. But according to YouTube, that’s exactly what you should be doing as a creator. It’s one of the growth strategies YouTube suggested in a recentShorts report.

In the screenshot above, you’ll see some of the same tactics Fellman uses. YouTube encourages creators to make really short videos and add frames to the end if they want to create loops.
But maybe you’re just getting started with Shorts. If you aren’t in the looping phase just yet,do this one thingto increase views on short, vertical videos.

Title: Quality Watch Time: YouTube's New Metric Could Change Everything

Quality Watch Time: YouTube's New Metric Could Change Everything
It's no secret that YouTube has been dogged by controversy over these last two years, with questionable content that seemingly gets pushed by the algorithm. Now, it's been confirmed that the platform has been working on two new metrics and they are both designed around the concept of gaging and promoting quality content. So what are these metrics, and what do they potentially mean for video creators?
New YouTube Metrics: Engagement Watch Time?
The first one sounds like a jacked up super enhanced version of session watch time. It will track, not only time spent on the YouTube platform watching videos, but also time spent posting and reading comments. So while posting comments may seem like something that's pretty easy to gain (after all how many sub-comments do you have on your channel?), if YouTube is going to start tracking how long a viewer spends on a Watch page reading comments, that's an entirely different and interesting proposition.
This sounds like a metric that might be called Engagement Watch Time. But, on the other hand, earlier on in the year YouTube was forced into a sweeping blanketban of comments on videos containing children, and while YouTube are slowly resolving this problem, if you do have comments disabled on your videos, for any reason, how do you benefit from this particular metric?

New YouTube Metrics: Quality Watch Time
The second metric is simply and mysteriously called ‘Quality Watch Time’ which as of now, nobody outside Google completely understands. However,Bloomberg does statethat the new metric aims to “spot content that achieves something more constructive than just keeping users glued to their phones or desktops.”
What this potentially means is that YouTube maybe starting to distance themselves from what is considered the most important metric on YouTube, raw Watch Time. With the consensus being that more outlandish, more risque content leads to more Watch Time which is something YouTube keeps being dogged by because of controversial content.
Bloomberg goes on to say “the changes are supposed to reward videos that are more palatable to advertisers and the broader public, and help YouTube ward off criticism that its service is addictive and socially corrosive.” Did you notice an important word there? Advertisers. Does that mean search and discovery of your content could be influenced by whether or not its monetized in the future?

Title: YouTube Watch Time: The Secret Sauce to More YouTube Views and Subscribers

YouTube Watch Time: The Secret Sauce to More YouTube Views and Subscribers
Pay attention because this tip is super important. Why? Because YouTube wants you to get as much Watch Time as possible in every single video that you make. For those who've never heard this term before, Watch Time is generally considered the most important metric on YouTube. Basically it is the physical number of minutes and hours your content is watched for by people on YouTube. But why is Watch Time more important than views?
Watch Time: Good for YouTube, Good for Video Creators
Let's take a look at it from this perspective. Views represent clicks, or visits, but they don't tell you for how long somebody is on the YouTube platform or on the mobile app. The more Watch Time YouTube has from its audience, the more ads they can sell to the audience, making more money for YouTube, and more money for the video creator. So it stands to reason that the more Watch Time you can create from your videos, the more YouTube is going to reward you, and share your content with more people. Win win win.
But also bear in mind that you don't have to monetize your content to benefit from this. The search and discovery engine is separate from the monetization engine. Let's do a simple example here. You've got a video with 1,000 views, with an average view duration of one minute. That gives you 1,000 minutes of Watch Time in total. But you've also got a video with 500 views, with five minutes of Watch Time, which gives you a total of 2,500 minutes of Watch Time. Which do you think has the better chance of doing well on YouTube in the long run? Yeah, it's probably video B.

YouTube have stated that when it comes to Watch Time, audience retention is hugely important, but there are a lot of ways to get more Watch Time, and that's what we're gonna explore right now.
Using YouTube Analytics to Confirm Watch Time Stats
Let's look at the numbers first. If you haven't already seen ourbeginner's guide to YouTube analytics, I recommend you watch that video at some point to help with navigating around these screens more confidently.
With that being said, on the Creator Studio dashboard, click on ‘Analytics’, and then at the top of the graphs, click on the ‘Interest Viewers’ tab. You should now see an average view duration box and if you click on this, it will show you a graph of on average how long your videos are watched for. This is useful from a channel perspective, and as we've already said, more is better.
But this graph doesn't take into account how long each individual video is. So to improve Watch Time, you really want to start by scrutinizing every single second of a single video. To do this, click on the ‘Videos’ link to the left, which lists all of your videos. Then choose a video you want to analyze. Click now on the analytics section, and on the first screen here, you should see this audience retention box.
Now, you can make a video an hour long if you want to, but if nobody's watching it after a single minute, that's going to send some pretty negative signals to YouTube. Audience retention is all about keeping that viewer interested throughout the entirety of your video. Keeping them informed, interested, intrigued, and entertained. And you want to try and get that audience retention to as close to 100% as possible. Generally speaking, that's very difficult to do. So a general benchmark is somewhere around about 50%. And this box will tell you all that, the total length of the video, and the average view duration converted into a percentage.
To really drill down into this data, you can click on the ‘See More’ button, and then watch the video to see where there are peaks and dips in your content. There's always loads of useful stuff you can glean from audience retention graphs, like why Audience increase or decreased at a certain point in the video.
The Importance of Short Video Intros
Let's talk about how important video intros are. You are always going to have a sharp drop off in viewership as soon as the video starts. For some viewers, the content is just not going to click, and they will turn off instantly. And then there's gonna be another group of viewers who may stick around more maybe 15 or 30 seconds to try and determine whether this video delivers in some way from the thumbnail and the title. That's why there needs to be some sort of hook or payoff. A way to entice a viewer to invest a few more minutes into the video, and hopefully keep them engaged for the entirety of the video. You can look back at pretty much any video on vidIQ, and you'll see me trying to entertain, inform, or intrigue you in those first 15 seconds before you see the vidIQ splash screen. That is my attempt to get you to watch longer, and I think it works, generally speaking.
On educational videos, creators will give you the final result at the beginning of the video, and then the rest of the video is about how to get there. For compilations or stories, there may be an epic part of the video that's used at the very beginning intro, and you don't actually see that part until maybe four or five minutes into the actual video. It's kind of like teasing a story before you watch the beginning of it. So if you've not tried this before, experiment with a dedicated intro to your video, and try to keep it to 15 seconds or less. Oh, and your branded intro or bumper should be no longer than five seconds.
How to Keep the YouTube Viewer’s Attention with Pattern Interrupts
Because as you well know, the average audience attention span of a YouTube viewer can be pretty short. So how do you fix that? You do something called pattern interrupt. A pattern interrupt is a change of pace, tone, and style - think of pattern interrupts as attention reset buttons. You still know what the videos about, but there's something new to look at on the screen
I try to have a pattern interrupt at least once every ten seconds, but other video creators do pattern interrupts every two or three seconds. Now, there is one huge drawback to the video creator when you use pattern interrupts, and that's editing. It adds hours to the process. So try not to go overboard, and start to watch video creators who operate in your space on YouTube with a critical eye to see if they adopt pattern interrupt strategies, and how often they do it. You should start to notice that the best video creators in your space adopt a certain style and tone through pattern interrupts that you should be at least aware of if you're not trying to follow in some way. Also, consider using B-roll in your video to keep the YouTube viewer watching and entertained. And if you’re going to try and cover many topics in a single video, at least tell the viewer in the title or the video intro, or do another dedicated video on that topic. Stay focused, edit ruthlessly.
Don’t Create Long Videos for the Sake of it
The most important currency on YouTube is time. You want as much Watch Time as possible, but your viewer wants to spend their time on YouTube as efficiently as possible. Just because YouTube states that Watch Time is one of its most important ranking factors, doesn't mean you should make longer videos to get more Watch Time. You're pandering too much to an algorithm, and doing a disservice to your audience.

Title: I Didn't Get 4000 Watch Time Hours on YouTube... Do I Need To Start Again?

I Didn't Get 4000 Watch Time Hours on YouTube... Do I Need To Start Again?
With the New Year having just passed, you might be asking yourself “Do I need to start my watchtime from scratch to reach 4,000 hours in 2019?”
The short answer is no… but it’s a bit more nuanced than that.
YouTube’s 4,000 hour of watchtime: A breakdown
According to YouTube, in order to be eligible to apply for the Partner Program (YPP), you must meet the following requirements:

In this post, we’ll be focusing primarily on requirement number two: You have more than 4,000 watch hours in the previous 12 months.
Now you might be thinking, 12 months is a calendar year, but YouTube doesn’t measure watchtime by calendar years. Instead, YouTube measures the last 365 days of watchtime from your channel. In a nutshell, you need 4,000 hours of watch time in the last 12 months, up until today's date.
For example, let’s say today is January 2, 2019. YouTube will track watchtime all the way back to January 3, 2018. The next day (January 3, 2019), YouTube will track back to January 4, 2018, and so on.
This is why your total watchtime may actually go up and down as you try to achieve 4,000 hours. Large spikes in watchtime will be negated when they reach that 12 month threshold, as will large dips, so it’s smart to keep a watchful eye on this metric.
How to track my YouTube channel watchime
If you have the totally free vidIQ Chrome extension installed, you can easily track your watchtime in real-time on the top-right hand side of every YouTube page on desktop.
In the example below, the vidIQ displays the channel’s watchtime total as 3,100 hours over the past 12 months. You’ll notice the metric is in amber, meaning the channel hasn’t yet reached 4,000 hours. Once it has surpassed 4,000 hours, however, the metric will become green (you hit the target, pal!), and once you surpass 5,000 hours, it will disappear.
Along with watchtime hours, vidIQ also tracks number of subscribers, so you can keep those numbers top of mind, too.
Mouse over the little graph icon to reveal a full breakdown of channel stats, including the watchtime over the past 12 months and… (drumroll, please), a progress bar showing you exactly how close you are to hitting 4,000 hours.
Don’t see the watchtime metric with the vidIQ extension? Chances are you’ve already surpassed 5,000 hours, so way to go!
What happens when I hit 4,000 hours of watchtime?
Here’s some good news: You don't have to wait 12 months to hit that monetization threshold.
If you get 4,000 hours of watchtime in three months (umm, wow), so long as you have 1,000 subscribers you're already eligible to apply for the YPP. Note the keyword being eligible — you've still got to apply and then be approved before you can actually start monetizing your content.
Upon acceptance you might be stressing about keeping those watchtime hours up, but don’t panic, YouTube won’t kick you out if you dip below 4,000 hours so long as it’s clear you’re still active. Keep working hard, posting content you’ll be just fine.
Answer directly from YouTube Help. Cue huge sigh of relief.
